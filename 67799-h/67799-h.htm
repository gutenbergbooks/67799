<p class='c007'><span class='sc'>The Book of the Courtier</span> was written,
partly at Urbino and partly at Rome, between
the years 1508 and 1516, and was first
printed at the Aldine Press, Venice, in the
month of April, 1528.</p>

<p class='c008'>There have since been published more than one
hundred and forty editions, a list of which
will be found at page 417 of this volume.
The first Spanish version, by <span class='sc'>Juan Boscan
Almogaver</span>, was issued at Barcelona in
1534; the first French version, by <span class='sc'>Jacques
Colin</span>, was issued at Paris in 1537; the first
English version, by <span class='sc'>Thomas Hoby</span>, was issued
at London in 1561; the first Latin version,
by <span class='sc'>Hieronymus Turler</span>, was issued
at Wittenberg in 1561; the first German version,
by <span class='sc'>Lorenz Kratzer</span>, was issued at
Munich in 1566.</p>

<p class='c009'>The present edition consists of five hundred
numbered copies, of which this is No.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c010'>TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>The popularity long enjoyed by this old book, the place that it holds in
Italian literature, and the fact that it is almost inaccessible to English
readers, seem to furnish sufficient reason for a new translation.</p>

<p class='c001'>The art of the Italian Renaissance delights us by its delicate and gentle
beauty, and yet we know that life during this period was often gross and
violent. To understand this, we must remember that art is more the expression
of the ideal than of the actual, and that men’s ideals are loftier than their
practice. Castiglione gives utterance to the finest aspirations of his time.
His pages will lack interest only when mankind ceases to be interesting to
man, and will reward study so long as the past shall continue to instruct the
present and the future.</p>

<p class='c001'>The few deviations that the present translator has ventured to make from
the letter of the Italian text are merely verbal, and were deemed needful to
render its meaning clear. The notes that he offers are intended to explain
obscure passages and to relieve the reader from the tedium of searching in
books of reference. Perhaps no one will regard it as inopportune to be
reminded of what all may have known but few are able to remember with
precision. Students who may wish to learn from what Greek and Latin
sources Castiglione derived material are referred to Professor Vittorio Cian’s
admirable edition.</p>

<p class='c001'>The translator desires to express his thanks for the friendly encouragement
that he has received from Miss Grace Norton, at whose suggestion his task
was undertaken. He is indebted to Dr. Luigi Roversi and Signor Leopoldo
Jung for their patient aid, and to Signor Alessandro Luzio and many other
scholars, in Italy and elsewhere, for the kindness with which they have
helped him to gather portraits and bibliographical data. He gratefully
acknowledges, also, his frequent use of Professor Cian’s erudite labours, of
John Addington Symonds’s <span class='sc'>Renaissance in Italy</span>, and of James Dennistoun’s
<span class='sc'>Memoirs of the Dukes of Urbino</span>.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_1'>1</span>
  <h2 class='c012'>TO THE REVEREND AND ILLUSTRIOUS<br />LORD DOM MIGUEL DE SILVA,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a><br />BISHOP OF VISEU</h2>
</div>

<p class='c011'>1.—When my lord Guidobaldo di Montefeltro,<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Duke of Urbino,
passed from this life, I, together with several other cavaliers
who had served him, remained in the service of Duke Francesco
Maria della Rovere,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a> his heir and successor in the State. And as
the recollection of Duke Guido’s character was fresh in my mind,
and the delight I had during those years in the kind companionship
of the notable persons who at that time frequented the Court
of Urbino, I was moved by their memory to write these books of
the Courtier, which I did in a few days,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c016'><sup>[4]</sup></a> purposing in time to
correct those errours that arose from the wish to pay this debt
speedily. But for many years past fortune has burdened me
with toil so constant that I never could find leisure to make the
book such as would content even my poor judgment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now being in Spain,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c016'><sup>[5]</sup></a> and learning from Italy that my lady
Vittoria della Colonna, Marchioness of Pescara,<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c016'><sup>[6]</sup></a> to whom I gave
a copy of the book, had against her word caused a large part of
it to be transcribed, I could not but feel some annoyance, fearing
the many inconveniences that may befall in such cases. Still, I
relied upon the wit and good sense of this lady (whose character
I have always held in veneration as a thing divine) to prevent
any mischief coming to me from having obeyed her wishes. Finally
I was informed that this part of the book was in the hands
of many people at Naples; and as men are always eager for anything
new, it seemed likely that someone might try to have it
printed.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c016'><sup>[7]</sup></a> Alarmed at this peril, then, I resolved to revise the
book at once so far as I had time, with intent to publish it; for I
thought better to let it be seen imperfectly corrected by my own
hand than grievously mutilated by the hand of others.</p>

<p class='c001'>And so, to carry out this plan, I began to read the book again;
and touched at the very outset by the title, I was saddened not a
little, and far more so as I went on, by the thought that most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>of the personages introduced in the discussion were already
dead; for besides those mentioned in the proem of the last Book,
messer Alfonso Ariosto<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c016'><sup>[8]</sup></a> (to whom the work is dedicated) is also
dead, a gracious youth, considerate, of the highest breeding, and
apt in everything proper to a man who lives at court. Likewise
Duke Giuliano de’ Medici,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a> whose kindness and noble courtesy
deserved to be enjoyed longer by the world. Messer Bernardo,<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c016'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
Cardinal of Santa Maria in Portico, who for his keen and playful
readiness of wit was most delightful to all that knew him, he, too,
is dead. Dead also is my lord Ottaviano Fregoso,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c016'><sup>[11]</sup></a> a man very
rare in our times: magnanimous, devout, full of kindness, talent,
good sense, and courtesy, a true lover of honour and merit, and so
worthy of praise that his very enemies were ever forced to praise
him; and the misadventures that he bore so bravely were enough
to prove that fortune is still, as always, adverse to merit. And
of those mentioned in my book many more besides are dead, to
whom nature seemed to promise very long life.</p>

<p class='c001'>But what should not be told without tears is that my lady
Duchess,<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c016'><sup>[12]</sup></a> too, is dead. And if my heart mourns the loss of so
many friends and patrons, who have left me in this life as in a
solitude full of sorrows, it is meet that I grieve more bitterly for
the death of my lady Duchess than of all the others; for she was
more precious than they, and I more bound to her than to all the
others. Not to delay, then, the tribute that I owe the memory of so
excellent a Lady and of the others who are no more, and moved
also by the danger to my book, I have had it printed and published
in such state as the shortness of time permitted.</p>

<p class='c001'>And since you had no knowledge in their lifetime either of my
lady Duchess or of the others who are dead (except Duke Giuliano
and the Cardinal of Santa Maria in Portico), in order to
give you that knowledge after their death as far as I can, I send
you this book as a picture of the Court of Urbino, not by the hand
of Raphael<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c016'><sup>[98]</sup></a> or Michelangelo,<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c016'><sup>[99]</sup></a> but of a humble painter, who
knows only how to trace the chief lines, and cannot adorn truth
with bright colouring, or by perspective art make that which is
not seem to be. And although I tried to show forth in their discourse
the qualities and character of my personages, I own I failed
to express or even to suggest the excellences of my lady Duchess,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>not only because my style is inadequate to describe them, but because
my intelligence fails even to conceive of them;<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c016'><sup>[13]</sup></a> and if I be
censured for this or any other matter worthy of censure (for I
well know that my book contains many such), I shall not gainsay
the truth.</p>

<p class='c001'>2.—But as men sometimes so delight in finding fault that they
reprehend even that which does not merit reprehension, to such
as blame me because I did not imitate Boccaccio<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c016'><sup>[14]</sup></a> or conform to
the usages of present Tuscan speech, I shall not refrain from saying
that while, for his time, Boccaccio had a charming faculty and
often wrote with care and diligence, yet he wrote far better when
he followed only the guidance of his natural wit and instinct,
without further thought or care to polish his writings, than when
he strove industriously and laboriously to be more refined and
correct. For this reason even his followers declare that he
greatly erred in judgment concerning his own works, holding
cheap what did him honour<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c016'><sup>[15]</sup></a> and prizing what was worthless.
Therefore, if I had imitated that manner of writing which in Boccaccio
is censured by those who elsewise praise him, I should
not have been able to escape those same aspersions that were
cast on him in this regard; and I should have more deserved
them, because he committed his faults thinking he was doing
well, while I should have known I was doing ill. Again, if I had
imitated the style now admired by many but less esteemed by
him, it seemed to me that by such imitation I should show myself
at variance with him whom I was imitating, a thing I deemed
unseemly. And again, if this consideration had not moved me, I
was not able to imitate him in my subject-matter, for he never
wrote anything at all in the manner of these books of the Courtier;
and I thought I ought not to imitate him in language, because
the power and true law of good speech consist rather in
usage than in aught else, and it is always a bad habit to employ
words not in use. Therefore it was not meet for me to borrow
many of Boccaccio’s words that were used in his day, but are not
now used even by the Tuscans themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nor was I willing to limit myself to the Tuscan usage of to-day,
because intercourse between different nations has always
had the effect to transport, as it were like merchandise, new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>forms of speech from one to the other; and these endure or fail
according as custom accepts or rejects them. Besides being attested
by the ancients, this is clearly seen in Boccaccio, who used
so many French, Spanish, and Provençal words (some of them
perhaps not very intelligible to modern Tuscans) that if they
were all omitted his work would be far shorter.</p>

<p class='c001'>And since, in my opinion, we ought not to despise the idiom of
the other noble cities of Italy, whither men resort who are wise,
witty, and eloquent, wont to discourse on weighty matters of
statecraft, letters, war, and commerce, I think that, of the words
used in the speech of these places, I could fitly use in writing
such as are graceful in themselves, elegant to pronounce, and
commonly deemed good and expressive, although they might not
be Tuscan or even of Italian origin. Moreover, in Tuscany, many
words are used which are plainly corruptions of the Latin, but
which in Lombardy and other parts of Italy have remained pure
and unchanged, and are so generally employed by everyone that
they are accepted by the gentle and easily understood by the vulgar.
Hence I think I did not err if in writing I used some of
these words, or preferred what is whole and true speech of my
own country rather than what is corrupt and mutilated from
abroad.</p>

<p class='c001'>Neither do I regard as sound the maxim laid down by many,
that our common speech is the more beautiful the less it is like
Latin; nor do I understand why one fashion of speech should be
accorded so much greater authority than another, that, if the
Tuscan tongue can ennoble debased and mutilated Latin words
and lend them such grace that, mutilated as they are, they may
be used by anyone without reproach (which is not denied), the
Lombard or any other tongue may not support these same Latin
words, pure, whole, precise, and quite unchanged, so that they be
tolerable. And truly, just as to undertake, in spite of usage, to
coin new words or to preserve old ones may be called bold presumption,
so also, besides being difficult, it seems almost impious
to undertake, against the force of that same usage, to suppress
and bury alive, as it were, words that have already endured
for many centuries, protected by the shield of custom against the
envy of time, and have maintained their dignity and splendour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>through the changes in language, in buildings, in habits and in
customs, wrought by the wars and disasters of Italy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hence if in writing I have chosen not to use those words of
Boccaccio that are no longer used in Tuscany, nor to conform to
the rule of those who deem it not permissible to use any words
that the Tuscans of to-day do not use, I seem to myself excusable.
And I think that both in the matter and in the language of my
book (so far as one language can aid another), I have followed
authors as worthy of praise as is Boccaccio. Nor do I believe
that it ought to be counted against me as a fault that I have
elected to make myself known rather as a Lombard speaking
Lombard, than as a non-Tuscan speaking Tuscan too precisely,
in order that I might not resemble Theophrastus, who was
detected as non-Athenian by a simple old woman, because he
spoke the Athenian dialect with excess of care.<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c016'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But as this subject is sufficiently treated of in my first Book,<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c016'><sup>[17]</sup></a> I
shall say no more, except that, to prevent all possible discussion,
I grant my critics that I do not know this Tuscan dialect of theirs,
which is so difficult and recondite. And I declare that I have
written in my own dialect, just as I speak and for those who
speak as I do; and in this I think I have wronged no man,
because it seems to me that no one is forbidden to write and
speak in his own language; nor is anyone bound to read or listen
to what does not please him. Therefore if these folk do not care
to read my Courtier, I shall not hold myself in the least wronged
by them.</p>

<p class='c001'>3.—Others say that since it is so very hard and well nigh impossible
to find a man as perfect as I wish the Courtier to be,
it was superfluous to write of him, because it is folly to teach
what cannot be learned. To these I make answer that I am
content to have erred in company with Plato, Xenophon and
Marcus Tullius, leaving on one side all discussion about the
Intelligible World and Ideals; among which, just as are included
(according to those authors) the ideal of the perfect
State, of the perfect King and of the perfect Orator,<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c016'><sup>[18]</sup></a> so also is
the ideal of the perfect Courtier. And if in my style I have
failed to approach the image of this ideal, it will be so much the
easier for courtiers to approach in deeds the aim and goal that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>I have set them by my writing; and even if they fail to attain
the perfection, such as it is, that I have tried to express, he that
approaches nearest to it will be the most perfect; just as when
many archers shoot at a target and none hit the very mark,
surely he that comes nearest to it is better than the rest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Still others say that I thought to paint my own portrait, as if
I were convinced that I possessed all the qualities that I attribute
to the Courtier.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c016'><sup>[19]</sup></a> To these I shall not indeed deny having
essayed everything that I should wish the Courtier to know;
and I think that a man, however learned, who did not know
something of the matters treated of in the book, could not well
have written of them; but I am not so lacking in self-discernment
as to fancy that I know everything I have the wit to
desire.</p>

<p class='c001'>My defence then against these and perhaps many other accusations,
I leave for the present to the verdict of public opinion;
for while the many may not perfectly understand, yet oftener
than not they scent by natural instinct the savour of good and
bad, and without being able to explain why, they relish one
thing and like it, and reject another and hate it. Therefore if
my book wins general favour, I shall think it must be good and
ought to live;<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c016'><sup>[20]</sup></a> but if it fails to please, I shall think it must be
bad and soon to be forgot. And if my censors be not satisfied
with the common verdict of opinion, let them rest content with
that of time, which in the end reveals the hidden defects of
everything, and being father of truth and judge without passion,
ever passes on men’s writings just sentence of life or death.</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>THE FIRST BOOK OF THE COURTIER<br /> BY COUNT BALDESAR CASTIGLIONE</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c005'>
    <div>TO MESSER ALFONSO ARIOSTO</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><a id='sec1.1'></a>1.—Within myself I have long doubted, dearest messer Alfonso,
which of two things were the harder for me: to deny you
what you have often begged of me so urgently, or to do it. For
while it seemed to me very hard to deny anything (and especially
a thing in the highest degree laudable) to one whom I
love most dearly and by whom I feel myself to be most dearly
loved, yet to set about an enterprise that I was not sure of being
able to finish, seemed to me ill befitting a man who esteems just
censure as it ought to be esteemed. At last, after much thought,
I am resolved to try in this matter how much aid my assiduity
may gain from that affection and intense desire to please, which
in other things are so wont to stimulate the industry of man.</p>

<p class='c001'>You ask me then to write what is to my thinking the form of
Courtiership<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c016'><sup>[21]</sup></a> most befitting a gentleman who lives at the court
of princes, by which he may have the ability and knowledge
perfectly to serve them in every reasonable thing, winning
from them favour, and praise from other men; in short, what
manner of man he ought to be who may deserve to be called a
perfect Courtier without flaw. Wherefore, considering your
request, I say that had it not seemed to me more blameworthy
to be reputed somewhat unamiable by you than too conceited by
everyone else, I should have avoided this task, for fear of being
held over bold by all who know how hard a thing it is, from
among such a variety of customs as are in use at the courts of
Christendom, to choose the perfect form and as it were the
flower of Courtiership. For custom often makes the same
thing pleasing and displeasing to us; whence it sometimes follows
that customs, habits, ceremonies and fashions that once
were prized, become vulgar, and contrariwise the vulgar become
prized. Thus it is clearly seen that use rather than reason has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>power to introduce new things among us, and to do away with
the old; and he will often err who seeks to determine which are
perfect. Therefore being conscious of this and many other
difficulties in the subject set before me to write of, I am constrained
to offer some apology, and to testify that this errour (if
errour it may indeed be called) is common to us both, to the end
that if I be blamed for it, the blame maybe shared by you also;
for your offence in setting me a task beyond my powers should
not be deemed less than mine in having accepted it.</p>

<p class='c001'>So now let us make a beginning of our subject, and if possible
let us form such a Courtier that any prince worthy to be served
by him, although of but small estate,<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c016'><sup>[22]</sup></a> might still be called a

<p class='c001'>In these books we shall follow no fixed order or rule of distinct
precepts, such as are usually employed in teaching anything

we shall revive a pleasant memory and rehearse certain discussions

such matters; and although I had no part in them personally,
being in England at the time they took place,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c016'><sup>[23]</sup></a> yet having received
them soon after my return, from one who faithfully

my memory will permit, so that you may know what was thought
and believed on this subject by men who are worthy of highest
praise, and to whose judgment implicit faith may be given in all

so that we may reach in orderly manner the end to which
our discourse tends.</p>

<p>GUIDOBALDO DI MONTEFELTRO<br />DUKE OF URBINO<br />1472-1508</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>From Alinari’s photograph (no. 7351) of the portrait, in the Colonna Gallery at Rome,
variously attributed to Raphael’s father, Giovanni Santi (1440?-1494), and (by Morelli)
to Melozzo degli Ambrosi da Forli (1438-1494). Schmarzow’s iconographical identification
of this portrait (formerly supposed to represent Raphael as a boy) is confirmed
by its close resemblance to the young duke’s features as shown on coins issued in the
early years of his reign.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec1.2'></a>2.—On the slopes of the Apennines towards the Adriatic sea,
almost in the centre of Italy, there lies (as everyone knows) the
little city of Urbino. Although amid mountains, and less pleasing
ones than perhaps some others that we see in many places,
it has yet enjoyed such favour of heaven that the country round
about is very fertile and rich in crops; so that besides the wholesomeness
of the air, there is great abundance of everything
needful for human life. But among the greatest blessings that
can be attributed to it, this I believe to be the chief, that for a
long time it has ever been ruled by the best of lords;<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c016'><sup>[24]</sup></a> although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>in the calamities of the universal wars of Italy, it was for a
season deprived of them.<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c016'><sup>[25]</sup></a> But without seeking further, we can
give good proof of this by the glorious memory of Duke Federico,<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c016'><sup>[26]</sup></a>
who in his day was the light of Italy; nor is there lack
of credible and abundant witnesses, who are still living, to his
prudence, humanity, justice, liberality, unconquered courage,—and
to his military discipline, which is conspicuously attested by
his numerous victories, his capture of impregnable places, the
sudden swiftness of his expeditions, the frequency with which he
put to flight large and formidable armies by means of a very
small force, and by his loss of no single battle whatever;<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c016'><sup>[27]</sup></a> so
that we may not unreasonably compare him to many famous
men of old.</p>

<p class='c001'>Among his other praiseworthy deeds, he built on the rugged
site of Urbino a palace regarded by many as the most beautiful
to be found in all Italy; and he so well furnished it with everything
suitable that it seemed not a palace but a city in the form
of a palace; and not merely with what is ordinarily used,—such
as silver vases, hangings of richest cloth-of-gold and silk, and
other similar things,—but for ornament he added countless antique
statues in marble and bronze, pictures most choice, and
musical instruments of every sort, nor would he admit anything
there that was not very rare and excellent. Then at very great
cost he collected a goodly number of most excellent and rare
books in Greek, Latin and Hebrew, all of which he adorned
with gold and with silver, esteeming this to be the chiefest excellence
of his great palace.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c016'><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>3.—Following then the course of nature, and already sixty-five
years old,<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c016'><sup>[29]</sup></a> he died gloriously, as he had lived; and he left as his
successor a motherless little boy of ten years, his only son
Guidobaldo. Heir to the State, he seemed to be heir also to all
his father’s virtues, and soon his noble nature gave such promise
as seemed not permissible to hope for from mortal man; so that
men esteemed none among the notable deeds of Duke Federico
to be greater than to have begotten such a son. But envious of
so much virtue, fortune thwarted this glorious beginning with
all her power; so that before Duke Guido reached the age of
twenty years, he fell ill of the gout,<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c016'><sup>[30]</sup></a> which grew upon him with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>grievous pain, and in a short space of time so crippled all his
members that he could neither stand upon his feet nor move;
and thus one of the fairest and most promising forms in the
world was distorted and spoiled in tender youth.</p>

<p class='c001'>And not content even with this, fortune was so contrary to
him in all his purposes, that he could seldom carry into effect
anything that he desired; and although he was very wise of
counsel and unconquered in spirit, it seemed that what he undertook,
both in war and in everything else whether small or great,
always ended ill for him. And proof of this is found in his many
and diverse calamities, which he ever bore with such strength
of mind, that his spirit was never vanquished by fortune; nay,
scorning her assaults with unbroken courage, he lived in illness
as if in health and in adversity as if fortunate, with perfect dignity
and universal esteem; so that although he was thus infirm
of body, he fought with most honourable rank in the service of
their Serene Highnesses the Kings of Naples, Alfonso<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c016'><sup>[31]</sup></a> and
Ferdinand the Younger;<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c016'><sup>[32]</sup></a> later with Pope Alexander VI,<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c016'><sup>[33]</sup></a> and
with the Venetian and Florentine signories.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon the accession of Julius II<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c016'><sup>[34]</sup></a> to the pontificate, he was made
Captain of the Church; at which time, following his accustomed
habit, above all else he took care to fill his household with very
noble and valiant gentlemen, with whom he lived most familiarly,
delighting in their intercourse: wherein the pleasure he gave to
others was not less than that he received from others, he being
well versed in both the [learned]<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c016'><sup>[35]</sup></a> languages, and uniting affability
and pleasantness<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c016'><sup>[36]</sup></a> to a knowledge of things without number.
And besides this, the greatness of his spirit so set him on,
that although he could not practise in person the exercises of
chivalry, as he once had done, yet he took the utmost pleasure
in witnessing them in others; and by his words, now correcting
now praising every man according to desert, he clearly showed
his judgment in those matters; wherefore, in jousts and tournaments,
in riding, in the handling of every sort of weapon, as well
as in pastimes, games, music,—in short, in all the exercises
proper to noble cavaliers,—everyone strove so to show himself,
as to merit being deemed worthy of such noble fellowship.</p>

<p>EMILIA PIA<br />Died 1528</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Enlarged from a photograph, specially made by Mansell, of a cast, kindly furnished
by T. Whitcombe Greene, Esq., of a medal in his collection at Chandler’s
Ford, Hampshire, possibly the work of Giancristoforo Romano (1465?-1512). See
Armand’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Les Médailleurs Italiens</cite></span>, iii, 202.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec1.4'></a>4.—Thus all the hours of the day were assigned to honourable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>and pleasant exercises as well for the body as for the mind; but
since my lord Duke was always wont by reason of his infirmity to
retire to sleep very early after supper, everyone usually betook
himself at that hour to the presence of my lady Duchess, Elisabetta
Gonzaga; where also was ever to be found my lady Emilia Pia,<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c016'><sup>[37]</sup></a>
who was endowed with such lively wit and judgment that, as
you know, it seemed as if she were the Mistress of us all, and as
if everyone gained wisdom and worth from her. Here then,
gentle discussions and innocent pleasantries were heard, and on
the face of everyone a jocund gaiety was seen depicted, so that
the house could truly be called the very abode of mirth: nor
ever elsewhere, I think, was so relished, as once was here, how
great sweetness may flow from dear and cherished companionship;
for not to speak of the honour it was to each of us to serve
such a lord as he of whom I have just spoken, there was born in
the hearts of all a supreme contentment every time we came into
the presence of my lady Duchess; and it seemed as if this were
a chain that held us all linked in love, so that never was concord
of will or cordial love between brothers greater than that which
here was between us all.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same was it among the ladies, with whom there was
intercourse most free and honourable; for everyone was permitted
to talk, sit, jest and laugh with whom he pleased; but
such was the reverence paid to the wish of my lady Duchess,
that this same liberty was a very great check;<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c016'><sup>[38]</sup></a> nor was there
anyone who did not esteem it the utmost pleasure he could
have in the world, to please her, and the utmost pain to
displease her. And thus, most decorous manners were here
joined with greatest liberty, and games and laughter in her
presence were seasoned not only with witty jests, but with
gracious and sober dignity; for that modesty and loftiness
which governed all the acts, words and gestures of my lady
Duchess, bantering and laughing, were such that she would have
been known for a lady of noblest rank by anyone who saw her
even but once. And impressing herself thus upon those about
her, she seemed to attune us all to her own quality and tone;
accordingly every man strove to follow this pattern, taking as it
were a rule of beautiful behaviour from the presence of so great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and virtuous a lady; whose highest qualities I do not now purpose
to recount, they not being my theme and being well known
to all the world, and far more because I could not express them
with either tongue or pen; and those that perhaps might have
been somewhat hid, fortune, as if wondering at such rare virtue,
chose to reveal through many adversities and stings of calamity,
so as to give proof that in the tender breast of woman, in
company with singular beauty, there may abide prudence and
strength of soul, and all those virtues that even among stern
men are very rare.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c016'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>5.—But leaving this aside, I say that the custom of all the gentlemen
of the house was to betake themselves straightway after
supper to my lady Duchess; where, among the other pleasant
pastimes and music and dancing that continually were practised,
sometimes neat questions were proposed, sometimes ingenious
games were devised at the choice of one or another, in which
under various disguises the company disclosed their thoughts
figuratively to whom they liked best. Sometimes other discussions
arose about different matters, or biting retorts passed
lightly back and forth. Often “devices” (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>imprese</i></span>), as we now
call them, were displayed;<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c016'><sup>[40]</sup></a> in discussing which there was wonderful
diversion, the house being (as I have said) full of very
noble talents; among whom (as you know) the most famous
were my lord Ottaviano Fregoso, his brother messer Federico,<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c016'><sup>[41]</sup></a>
the Magnifico Giuliano de’ Medici, messer Pietro Bembo,<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c016'><sup>[42]</sup></a> messer
Cesare Gonzaga,<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c016'><sup>[43]</sup></a> Count Ludovico da Canossa,<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c016'><sup>[44]</sup></a> my lord
Gaspar Pallavicino,<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c016'><sup>[45]</sup></a> my lord Ludovico Pio,<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c016'><sup>[46]</sup></a> my lord Morello
da Ortona,<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c016'><sup>[47]</sup></a> Pietro da Napoli, messer Roberto da Bari,<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c016'><sup>[48]</sup></a> and
countless other very noble cavaliers. Moreover there were
many, who, although usually they did not dwell there constantly,
yet spent most of the time there: like messer Bernardo Bibbiena,
the Unico Aretino,<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c016'><sup>[49]</sup></a> Giancristoforo Romano,<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c016'><sup>[50]</sup></a> Pietro Monte,<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c016'><sup>[51]</sup></a>

flocked thither poets, musicians and all sorts of agreeable<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c016'><sup>[54]</sup></a> men,
and in every walk the most excellent that were to be found in Italy.</p>

<p>ELISABETTA GONZAGA<br />DUCHESS OF URBINO<br />1471-1526</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Reduced from Braun’s photograph (no. 41.121) of the portrait in the Uffizi Gallery at Florence,
variously ascribed to Andrea Mantegna (1431-1506), to Lorenzo Costa (1460-1535),
and to Francesco Bonsignori (1455-1519).</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec1.6'></a>6.—Now Pope Julius II, having by his presence and the aid
of the French brought Bologna under subjection to the apostolic
see in the year 1506, and being on his way back to Rome, passed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>through Urbino; where he was received with all possible honour
and with as magnificent and splendid state as could have been
prepared in any other noble city of Italy: so that besides the
pope, all the lord cardinals and other courtiers were most highly
gratified. And some there were, attracted by the charm of this
society, who tarried at Urbino many days after the departure of
the pope and his court; during which time not only were the
ordinary pastimes and diversions continued in the usual manner,
but every man strove to contribute something new, and especially
in the games, to which almost every evening was devoted. And
the order of them was such that immediately after reaching
the presence of my lady Duchess, everyone sat down in a circle
as he pleased or as chance decided; and in sitting they were
arranged alternately, a man and a woman, as long as there
were women, for nearly always the number of men was by far
the greater; then they were governed as seemed best to my
lady Duchess, who for the most part left this charge to my lady
Emilia.</p>

<p class='c001'>So, the day after the pope’s departure,<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c016'><sup>[55]</sup></a> the company being
assembled at the wonted hour and place, after much pleasant
talk, my lady Duchess desired my lady Emilia to begin the
games; and she, after having for a time refused the task, spoke
thus:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lady, since it pleases you that I shall be the one to begin
the games this evening, not being able in reason to fail to obey
you, I will propose a game in which I think I ought to have
little blame and less labour; and this shall be for everyone to
propose after his liking a game that has never been given; and
then we will choose the one that seems best worthy to be played
in this company.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And so saying, she turned to my lord Gaspar Pallavicino, requiring
him to tell his choice; and he at once replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is for you, my Lady, first to tell your own.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But I have already told it,” said my lady Emilia; “now do
you, my lady Duchess, bid him be obedient.”<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c016'><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lady Duchess said, smiling:</p>

<p class='c001'>“To the end that everyone may be bound to obey you, I make
you my deputy and give you all my authority.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span><a id='sec1.7'></a>7.—“It is a remarkable thing,” replied my lord Gaspar, “that
women should always be allowed this exemption from toil,
and it certainly would not be unreasonable to wish in some
way to learn the reason why; but not to be the first to disobey,
I will leave this for another time, and will tell what is required
of me;” and he began: “It seems to me that in love, as in
everything else, our minds judge diversely; and thus it often
happens that what is very delightful to one man, is very hateful
to another; but none the less we all are ever alike in this,
that every man holds his beloved very dear; so that the over
fondness of lovers often cheats their judgment to such a degree,
that they esteem the person whom they love to be the only one
in the world adorned with every excellent virtue and wholly
without defect; but since human nature does not admit such
complete perfection, and since there is no one to be found who
does not lack something, it cannot be said that such men do not
cheat themselves, and that the lover does not become blind concerning
the beloved. I would therefore that this evening our
game might be that each of us should tell what virtue above
others he would have the person whom he loves adorned with;
and then, as all must have some blemish, what fault he would
have in her; in order that we may see who can find the most
praiseworthy and useful virtues, and the most excusable faults
and least harmful to lover and beloved.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Gaspar having spoken thus, my lady Emilia made
sign to madonna Costanza Fregosa<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c016'><sup>[57]</sup></a> to follow after, because
she sat next in order, and she was preparing to speak; but my
lady Duchess said quickly:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Since my lady Emilia will not make the effort to invent a
game, it were only fair that the other ladies share this ease and
that they too be exempt from such exertion for this evening,
especially as there are here so many men that there is no danger
of lack of games.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“So be it,” replied my lady Emilia; and imposing silence on
madonna Costanza, she turned to messer Cesare Gonzaga, who
sat next, and bade him speak; and he began thus:</p>

<p class='c001'>8.—“Whoso will carefully consider all our actions, will ever
find various defects in them; the reason whereof is that nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>variable in this as in other things, has given to one man the
light of reason in one thing, to another man in another thing;
and so it happens that, the one knowing what the other does not
know and being ignorant of what the other understands, each
readily perceives his neighbour’s fault and not his own, and we
all seem to ourselves very wise and perhaps most of all in that
wherein we most are foolish. Thus we have seen it happen in
this house that many, at first accounted very wise, were in course
of time recognized as very foolish, which came about from nothing
else but our own watchfulness. For, as they say that in Apulia
musical instruments are used for those bitten by the tarantula,<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c016'><sup>[58]</sup></a>
and various tunes are tried until the humour that causes the
malady (through a certain affinity it has for some one of those
tunes) is suddenly stirred by the sound, and so excites the sick
man that he is restored to health by virtue of that excitement: so
when we have perceived a hidden touch of folly, we have stimulated
it so artfully and with such various persuasions and diverse
means, that at length we have learned whither it tended; then,
the humour once recognized, so well have we excited it that it has
always reached the perfection of open folly. Thus one man has
waxed foolish over poetry, another over music, another over love,
another over dancing, another over inventing mimes,<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c016'><sup>[59]</sup></a> another
over riding, another over fencing,—each according to the native
quality of his metal; whence, as you know, great amusement has
been derived. I hold it then as certain that there is some grain
of folly in each of us, which being quickened can multiply almost
infinitely.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore I would that this evening our game might be a
discussion upon this subject, and that each one tell with what
kind of folly, and about what thing, he thinks I should make a
fool of myself if I had to make a fool of myself openly, judging
of this outburst by the sparks of folly that are daily seen to issue
from me. Let the same be told of all the rest, keeping to the
order of our games, and let each one try to found his opinion
upon some actual sign and argument. And thus we shall each
derive from our game the advantage of learning our defects, and
so shall be better able to guard against them; and if the vein of
folly that is discovered proves so rich that it seems incurable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>we will assist it, and according to fra Mariano’s<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c016'><sup>[60]</sup></a> teaching, we
shall have saved a soul, which will be no small gain.”</p>

<p class='c001'>There was much laughter at this game, nor were there any
who could keep from talking; one said, “I should make a fool
of myself over thinking;” another, “Over looking;” another
said, “I have already made a fool of myself over loving;” and
the like.</p>

<p class='c001'>9.—Then fra Serafino<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c016'><sup>[61]</sup></a> said, laughing after his manner:</p>

<p class='c001'>“That would take too long; but if you want a fine game, let
everyone give his opinion why it is that nearly all women hold
rats in hatred, and are fond of snakes; and you will see that no
one will guess the reason except myself, who learned this secret
in a strange way.” And he began to tell his stories; but my
lady Emilia bade him be silent, and passing over the lady who
sat next, made sign to the Unico Aretino whose turn it was; and
he, without waiting for further command, said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I would I were a judge with power to search the heart of
evil-doers by every sort of torture; and this that I might fathom
the deceits of an ingrate with angel eyes and serpent heart, who
never lets her tongue reveal her soul, and with deceitful pity
feigned has no thought but of dissecting hearts. Nor is there in
sandy Libya to be found a serpent so venomous and eager for
human blood as is this false one; who not only in the sweetness
of her voice and honeyed words, but in her eyes, her smiles, her
aspect and in all her ways, is a very siren.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But since I am not suffered, as I would I were, to use chains,
rope and fire to learn a certain truth, I fain would learn it by a
game,—which is this: let each one tell what he believes to be
the meaning of that letter S which my lady Duchess wears upon
her brow;<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c016'><sup>[62]</sup></a> for, although this too is surely an artful veil to aid
deceit, perchance there will be given it some interpretation
unthought of by her perhaps, and it will be found that fortune,
compassionate spectatress of men’s martyrdoms, has led her
against her will to disclose by this small token her secret wish
to slay and bury alive in calamity everyone who beholds her or
serves her.”</p>

<p>BERNARDO ACCOLTI<br />THE UNICO ARETINO<br />1465?-1535</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>My lady Duchess laughed, and the Unico, seeing that she
wished to defend herself against this imputation, said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, my Lady, do not speak, for it is not now your turn to
speak.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lady Emilia then turned and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sir Unico, there is no one of us here who does not yield to
you in everything, but above all in knowledge of my lady
Duchess’s mind; and since you know it better than the others
(thanks to your divine genius), you love it better than the others,
who like those weak-sighted birds that fix not their eyes upon
the sun’s orb, cannot so justly know how perfect it is; wherefore
every effort to clear this doubt would be vain, save your own
judgment. To you alone then be left this task, as to him who
alone can perform it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Unico remained silent for a while, then being urged to
speak, at last recited a sonnet upon the aforesaid subject, declaring
what that letter S meant; which was by many believed to
be done impromptu, but as it was more ingenious and finished
than seemed to accord with the shortness of the time, it was
thought rather to have been prepared.<a href='#f62' class='c016'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>10.—Then having bestowed a merry plaudit in praise of the
sonnet, and talked of it awhile, my lord Ottaviano Fregoso,
whose turn it was, smilingly began as follows:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lords, if I were to affirm that I had never felt the passion
of love, I am sure that my lady Duchess and my lady
Emilia would feign to believe it even though they believed it
not, and would say that it was because I mistrusted ever being
able to prevail upon any woman to love me; whereof indeed I
have not made trial hitherto with such persistence as reasonably
to despair of being able sometime to succeed. But yet I have
not refrained because I rate myself so high, or women so low,
that I do not deem many of them worthy to be loved and served
by me; but made timourous rather by the continual laments of
some lovers, who—pallid, gloomy and taciturn—seem always to
wear their unhappiness depicted in their eyes; and if they speak,
they accompany every word with triple sighs, and discourse of
nothing but tears, torments, despairings and longings for death;
so that if an amourous spark has sometimes kindled in my heart, I
have at once striven with all my might to quench it, not from any
hate I bear to women as these ladies think, but for my own good.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“I have also known some others quite different from these dolourous
souls,—lovers who not only give thanks and praise for
the kind looks, tender words and gentle bearing of their mistresses,
but flavour all evils with sweetness, so that they call
their ladies’ warrings, anger and disdain, most <a id='corr18.5'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sweet'>sweet.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_18.5'><ins class='correction' title='sweet'>sweet.</ins></a></span> Wherefore
such as these seem to me far more than happy. For if they
find such sweetness in lovers’ quarrels, which those others deem
far more bitter than death, I think that in loving endearments
they must enjoy that supreme beatitude which we vainly seek in
this world. So I would that this evening our game might be,
that each man tell, if she whom he loves must needs be angry
with him, by what cause he would have her anger roused. Because
if there be any here who have enjoyed this sweet anger, I
am sure that out of courtesy they will choose one of those
causes that make it so sweet; and perhaps I shall take courage
to advance a little farther in love, hoping that I too may find this
sweetness where some find bitterness; and then these ladies will
be no longer able to cast shame upon me because I do not love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>11.—This game found much favour and everyone made ready
to speak upon the subject, but as my lady Emilia made no further
mention of it, messer Pietro Bembo, who sat next in order, spoke
thus:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lords, no small uncertainty has been awakened in my
mind by the game proposed by my lord Ottaviano in his discourse
about love’s anger: the which, however varied it be, has
in my case always been most bitter, nor do I believe that any
seasoning could be learned from me that would avail to sweeten
it; but perhaps it is more or less bitter according to the cause
from which it springs.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c016'><sup>[63]</sup></a> For I remember once to have seen the
lady whom I served wrought up against me, either by some idle
suspicion that she had herself conceived as to my loyalty, or by
some other false notion awakened in her by what others had said to
my injury; insomuch that I believed no pain could equal mine, and
it seemed to me that the greatest suffering I felt was to endure that
which I had not deserved, and to have this affliction come upon me
not from my fault but from her lack of love. At other times I saw
her angered by some errour of mine, and knew her ire to proceed
from my fault; and then I deemed that my former woe was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>very light compared with that which now I felt; and it seemed
to me that to have displeased, and through my own guilt, the
person whom alone I desired and so zealously strove to please,
was the greatest torment and above all others. I would therefore
that our game might be that each man tell, if she whom he
loves must needs be angry with him, from which of the two he
would have her anger spring, from her or from himself; so that
we may know which is the greater suffering, to give displeasure
to her who is loved, or to receive it from her who is loved.”</p>

<p class='c001'>12.—Everyone waited for my lady Emilia to reply; but she,
saying nothing more to Bembo, turned and made sign to messer
Federico Fregoso that he should tell his game; and he at once
began as follows:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lady, I would it were permitted me, as it sometimes is,
to assent to another’s proposal; since for my part I would
readily approve any of the games proposed by these gentlemen,
for I really think that all of them would be amusing. But not
to break our rule, I say that anyone who wished to praise our
court,—laying aside the merit of our lady Duchess, which with
her divine virtue would suffice to lift from earth to heaven the
meanest souls that are in the world,—might well say without
suspicion of flattery, that in all Italy it would perhaps be hard to
find so many cavaliers so singularly admirable and so excellent
in divers other matters besides the chief concerns of chivalry, as
are now to be found here: wherefore if anywhere there be
men who deserve to be called good Courtiers and who are able
to judge of what pertains to the perfection of Courtiership, it is
reasonable to believe that they are here. So, to repress the
many fools who by impudence and folly think to win the name
of good Courtier, I would that this evening’s game might be,
that we select some one of the company and give him the task
of portraying a perfect Courtier, explaining all the conditions
and special qualities requisite in one who deserves this title;
and as to those things that shall not appear sound, let everyone
be allowed to contradict, as in the schools of the philosophers it
is allowed to contradict anyone who proposes a thesis.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Federico was continuing his discourse still further,
when my lady Emilia interrupted him and said:</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“This, if it pleases my lady Duchess, shall for the present be
our game.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lady Duchess answered:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It does please me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then nearly all those present began to say, both to my lady
Duchess and among themselves, that this was the finest game
that could possibly be; and without waiting for each other’s
answer, they entreated my lady Emilia to decide who should
begin. She turned to my lady Duchess and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Command, my Lady, him who it best pleases you should
have this task; for I do not wish, by selecting one rather than another,
to seem to decide whom I think more competent in this
matter than the rest, and so do wrong to anyone.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lady Duchess replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, make this choice yourself, and take heed lest by not
obeying you give an example to the others, so that they too
prove disobedient in their turn.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec1.13'></a>13.—At this my lady Emilia laughed and said to Count Ludovico
da Canossa:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then not to lose more time, you, Count, shall be the one
to take this enterprise after the manner that messer Federico
has described; not indeed because we account you so good a
Courtier that you know what befits one, but because, if you say
everything wrong as we hope you will, the game will be more
lively, for everyone will then have something to answer you;
while if someone else had this task who knew more than you, it
would be impossible to contradict him in anything, because he
would tell the truth, and so the game would be tedious.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Count answered quickly:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Whoever told the truth, my Lady, would run no risk of lacking
contradiction, so long as you were present;” and after some
laughter at this retort, he continued: “But truly I would fain
escape this burden, it seeming to me too heavy, and I being conscious
that what you said in jest is very true; that is, that I do
not know what befits a good Courtier: and I do not seek to
prove this with further argument, because, as I do not practise
the rules of Courtiership, one may judge that I do not know
them; and I think my blame may be the less, for sure it is worse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>not to wish to do well than not to know how. Yet, since it so
happens that you are pleased to have me bear this burden, I
neither can nor will refuse it, in order not to contravene our rule
and your judgment, which I rate far higher than my own.”</p>

<p>COUNT LUDOVICO DA CANOSSA<br />1476-1532</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Reduced from a photograph, specially made through the courtesy of the Bishop of
Bayeux, of an anonymous portrait in his possession. The sadly injured condition
of the original rendered it necessary to retouch the negative, in which process recourse
was had to a small photograph, kindly furnished by the Marquess Ottavio di Canossa,
of his copy of the Bayeux portrait.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Cesare Gonzaga said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“As the early evening is now spent and many other kinds
of entertainment are ready, perhaps it will be well to put off this
discussion until to-morrow and give the Count time to think of
what he has to say; for it is difficult indeed to speak unprepared
on such a subject.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Count replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not wish to be like the fellow who, when stripped to his
shirt, vaulted less well than he had done in his doublet; hence it
seems to me good fortune that the hour is late, for I shall be
obliged by the shortness of the time to say but little, and my not
having taken thought will excuse me, so that I shall be allowed
to say without blame whatever first comes to my lips.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore, not to carry this burden of duty longer on my
shoulders, I say that in everything it is so hard to know the true
perfection as to be well nigh impossible; and this because of the
variety of opinions. Thus there are many that will like a man
who speaks much, and will call him pleasing; some will prefer
modesty; some others, an active and restless man; still others,
one who shows calmness and deliberation in everything; and so
every man praises or decries according to his mind, always
clothing vice with the name of its kindred virtue, or virtue with
the name of its kindred vice; for example, calling an impudent
man frank, a modest man dull, an ignorant man good, a knave
discreet; and so in all things else. Yet I believe that there exists
in everything its own perfection, although concealed; and that
this can be determined through rational discussion by any having
knowledge of the thing in hand. And since, as I have said, the
truth often lies concealed, and I do not profess to have this knowledge,
I can only praise the kind of Courtier that I most esteem,
and approve him who seems to me nearest right, according to my
poor judgment; the which you will follow if you find it good, or
you will hold to your own if it differs from mine. Nor shall I at
all insist that mine is better than yours; not only because you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>may think one thing and I another, but I myself may sometimes
think one thing, and sometimes another.</p>

<p class='c001'>14.—“I wish, then, that this Courtier of ours should be nobly
born and of gentle race; because it is far less unseemly for one
of ignoble birth to fail in worthy deeds, than for one of noble
birth, who, if he strays from the path of his predecessors, stains
his family name, and not only fails to achieve but loses what has
been achieved already; for noble birth is like a bright lamp that
manifests and makes visible good and evil deeds, and kindles
and stimulates to virtue both by fear of shame and by hope of
praise. And since this splendour of nobility does not illumine
the deeds of the humbly born, they lack that stimulus and fear
of shame, nor do they feel any obligation to advance beyond what
their predecessors have done; while to the nobly born it seems a
reproach not to reach at least the goal set them by their ancestors.
And thus it nearly always happens that both in the profession
of arms and in other worthy pursuits the most famous
men have been of noble birth, because nature has implanted in
everything that hidden seed which gives a certain force and
quality of its own essence to all things that are derived from it,
and makes them like itself: as we see not only in the breeds of
horses and of other animals, but also in trees, the shoots of which
nearly always resemble the trunk; and if they sometimes degenerate,
it arises from poor cultivation. And so it is with men,
who if rightly trained are nearly always like those from whom
they spring, and often better; but if there be no one to give them
proper care, they become like savages and never reach perfection.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is true that, by favour of the stars or of nature, some men
are endowed at birth with such graces that they seem not to
have been born, but rather as if some god had formed them with
his very hands and adorned them with every excellence of mind
and body. So too there are many men so foolish and rude that
one cannot but think that nature brought them into the world
out of contempt or mockery. Just as these can usually accomplish
little even with constant diligence and good training, so
with slight pains those others reach the highest summit of excellence.
And to give you an instance: you see my lord Don Ippolito
d’Este,<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c016'><sup>[64]</sup></a> Cardinal of Ferrara, who has enjoyed such fortune
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>from his birth, that his person, his aspect, his words and all his
movements are so disposed and imbued with this grace, that—although
he is young—he exhibits among the most aged prelates
such weight of character that he seems fitter to teach than to be
taught; likewise in conversation with men and women of every
rank, in games, in pleasantry and in banter, he has a certain
sweetness and manners so gracious, that whoso speaks with him
or even sees him, must needs remain attached to him forever.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>“But to return to our subject: I say that there is a middle
state between perfect grace on the one hand and senseless folly
on the other; and those who are not thus perfectly endowed by
nature, with study and toil can in great part polish and amend
their natural defects. Besides his noble birth, then, I would
have the Courtier favoured in this regard also, and endowed by
nature not only with talent and beauty of person and feature,
but with a certain grace and (as we say) air that shall make him
at first sight pleasing and agreeable to all who see him; and I
would have this an ornament that should dispose and unite all
his actions, and in his outward aspect give promise of whatever
is worthy the society and favour of every great lord.”</p>

<p class='c001'>15.—Here, without waiting longer, my lord Gaspar Pallavicino
said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“In order that our game may have the form prescribed, and
that we may not seem to slight the privilege given us to contradict,
I say that this nobility of birth does not appear to me so
essential in the Courtier; and if I thought I were saying what
was new to any of us, I should cite instances of many men born
of the noblest blood who have been full of vices; and on the
other hand, of many men among the humbly born who by their
virtue have made their posterity illustrious. And if what you
just said be true, namely that there is in everything this occult
influence of the original seed, then we should all be in the same
case, because we had the same origin, nor would any man be
more noble than another. But as to our differences and grades
of eminence and obscurity, I believe there are many other
causes: among which I rate fortune to be chief; for we see her
holding sway in all mundane affairs, often amusing herself by
lifting to heaven whom she pleases (although wholly without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>merit), and burying in the depths those most worthy to be
exalted.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I quite agree with what you say as to the good fortune of
those endowed from birth with advantages of mind and body:
but this is seen as well among the humbly born as among
the nobly born, since nature has no such subtle distinctions as
these; and often, as I said, the highest gifts of nature are found
among the most obscure. Therefore, since this nobility of birth
is won neither by talent nor by strength nor by craft, and is
rather the merit of our predecessors than our own, it seems to
me too extravagant to maintain that if our Courtier’s parents be
humbly born, all his good qualities are spoiled, and that all those
other qualifications that you mentioned do not avail to raise him
to the summit of perfection; I mean talent, beauty of feature,
comeliness of person, and that grace which makes him always
charming to everyone at first sight.”</p>

<p class='c001'>16.—Then Count Ludovico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not deny that the same virtues may rule the low-born
and the noble: but (not to repeat what we have said already or
the many other arguments that could be adduced in praise of
noble birth, which is honoured always and by everyone, it being
reasonable that good should beget good), since we have to form
a Courtier without flaw and endowed with every praiseworthy
quality, it seems to me necessary to make him nobly born, as
well for many other reasons as for universal opinion, which is at
once disposed in favour of noble birth. For if there be two
Courtiers who have as yet given no impression of themselves by
good or evil acts, as soon as the one is known to have been born
a gentleman and the other not, he who is low-born will be far
less esteemed by everyone than he who is high-born, and will
need much effort and time to make upon men’s minds that good
impression which the other will have achieved in a moment and
merely by being a gentleman. And how important these impressions
are, everyone can easily understand: for in our own case
we have seen men present themselves in this house, who, being
silly and awkward in the extreme, yet had throughout Italy the
reputation of very great Courtiers; and although they were
detected and recognized at last, still they imposed upon us for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>many days, and maintained in our minds that opinion of them
which they first found impressed there, although they conducted
themselves after the slightness of their worth. We have seen
others, held at first in small esteem, then admirably successful
at the last.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And of these mistakes there are various causes: and among
others, the regard of princes, who in their wish to perform miracles
sometimes undertake to bestow favour on a man who seems
to them to merit disfavour. And often too they are themselves
deceived; but since they always have a host of imitators, their
favour begets very great fame, which chiefly guides our judgments:
and if we find anything that seems contrary to common
opinion, we suspect that it is we ourselves who are wrong, and
always seek for something hidden: because it seems that these
universal opinions must after all be founded on fact and spring
from rational causes; and because our minds are very prone to
love and hate, as is seen in battle-shows and games and every
other sort of contest, wherein the spectators without apparent
cause become partisans of one side, with eager wish that it may
win and the other lose. In our opinion of men’s character also,
good or evil fame sways our minds to one of these two passions
from the start; and thus it happens that we usually judge with
love or hate. You see then how important this first impression
is, and how he ought to strive to make a good one at the outset,
who thinks to hold the rank and name of good Courtier.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec1.17'></a>17.—“But to come to some details, I am of opinion that the
principal and true profession of the Courtier ought to be that of
arms; which I would have him follow actively above all else,
and be known among others as bold and strong, and loyal to
whomsoever he serves. And he will win a reputation for these
good qualities by exercising them at all times and in all places,
since one may never fail in this without severest censure. And
just as among women, their fair fame once sullied never recovers
its first lustre, so the reputation of a gentleman who bears arms,
if once it be in the least tarnished with cowardice or other disgrace,
remains forever infamous before the world and full of
ignominy. Therefore the more our Courtier excels in this art,
the more he will be worthy of praise; and yet I do not deem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>essential in him that perfect knowledge of things and those other
qualities that befit a commander; since this would be too wide
a sea, let us be content, as we have said, with perfect loyalty
and unconquered courage, and that he be always seen to possess
them. For the courageous are often recognized even more in
small things than in great; and frequently in perils of importance
and where there are many spectators, some men are to be found,
who, although their hearts be dead within them, yet, moved by
shame or by the presence of others, press forward almost with
their eyes shut, and do their duty God knows how. While on
occasions of little moment, when they think they can avoid putting
themselves in danger without being detected, they are glad
to keep safe. But those who, even when they do not expect to be
observed or seen or recognized by anyone, show their ardour and
neglect nothing, however paltry, that may be laid to their charge,—they
have that strength of mind which we seek in our Courtier.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not that we would have him look so fierce, or go about
blustering, or say that he has taken his cuirass to wife, or
threaten with those grim scowls that we have often seen in
Berto;<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c016'><sup>[65]</sup></a> because to such men as this, one might justly say that
which a brave lady jestingly said in gentle company to one
whom I will not name at present;<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c016'><sup>[66]</sup></a> who, being invited by her
out of compliment to dance, refused not only that, but to listen
to the music, and many other entertainments proposed to him,—saying
always that such silly trifles were not his business; so
that at last the lady said, ‘What is your business, then?’ He
replied with a sour look, ‘To fight.’ Then the lady at once said,
‘Now that you are in no war and out of fighting trim, I should
think it were a good thing to have yourself well oiled, and to
stow yourself with all your battle harness in a closet until you
be needed, lest you grow more rusty than you are;’ and so,
amid much laughter from the bystanders, she left the discomfited
fellow to his silly presumption.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore let the man we are seeking, be very bold, stern,
and always among the first, where the enemy are to be seen;
and in every other place, gentle, modest, reserved, above all
things avoiding ostentation and that impudent self-praise by
which men ever excite hatred and disgust in all who hear them.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>18.—Then my lord Gaspar replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“As for me, I have known few men excellent in anything
whatever, who do not praise themselves; and it seems to me
that this may well be permitted them; for when anyone who
feels himself to be of worth, sees that he is not known to the
ignorant by his works, he is offended that his worth should lie
buried, and needs must in some way hold it up to view, in order
that he may not be cheated of the fame that is the true reward
of worthy effort. Thus among the ancient authors, whoever
carries weight seldom fails to praise himself. They indeed are
insufferable who do this without desert, but such we do not presume
our Courtier to be.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Count then said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you heard what I said, it was impudent and indiscriminate
self-praise that I censured: and as you say, we surely ought not
to form a bad opinion of a brave man who praises himself modestly,
nay we ought rather to regard such praise as better evidence
than if it came from the mouth of others. I say, however,
that he, who in praising himself runs into no errour and incurs
no annoyance or envy at the hands of those that hear him, is a
very discreet man indeed and merits praise from others in addition
to that which he bestows upon himself; because it is a very
difficult matter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You must teach us that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Count replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Among the ancient authors there is no lack of those who
have taught it; but to my thinking, the whole art consists in
saying things in such a way that they shall not seem to be said
to that end, but let fall so naturally that it was impossible not to
say them, and while seeming always to avoid self-praise, yet to
achieve it; but not after the manner of those boasters, who open
their mouths and let the words come forth haphazard. Like
one of our friends a few days ago, who, being quite run through
the thigh with a spear at Pisa, said he thought it was a fly that
had stung him; and another man said he kept no mirrour in his
room because, when angry, he became so terrible to look at,
that the sight of himself would have frightened him too much.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>Everyone laughed at this, but messer Cesare Gonzaga added:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why do you laugh? Do you not know that Alexander the
Great, on hearing the opinion of a philosopher<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c016'><sup>[67]</sup></a> to be that there
was an infinite number of worlds, began to weep, and being
asked why he wept, replied, ‘Because I have not yet conquered
one of them;’ as if he would fain have vanquished all? Does
not this seem to you a greater boast than that about the fly-sting?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the Count said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, and Alexander was a greater man than he who made
the other speech. But extraordinary men are surely to be pardoned
when they assume much; for he who has great things to
do must needs have daring to do them, and confidence in himself,
and must not be abject or mean in spirit, yet very modest in
speech, showing less confidence in himself than he has, lest his
self-confidence lead to rashness.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec1.19'></a>19.—The Count now paused a little, and messer Bernardo
Bibbiena said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I remember what you said earlier, that this Courtier of ours
must be endowed by nature with beauty of countenance and
person, and with a grace that shall make him so agreeable.
Grace and beauty of countenance I think I certainly possess, and
this is the reason why so many ladies are ardently in love with
me, as you know; but I am rather doubtful as to the beauty of
my person, especially as regards these legs of mine, which seem
to me decidedly less well proportioned than I should wish: as to
my bust and other members however, I am quite content. Pray,
now, describe a little more in particular the sort of body that
the Courtier is to have, so that I may dismiss this doubt and set
my mind at rest.”</p>

<p class='c001'>After some laughter at this, the Count continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of a certainty that grace of countenance can be truly said to
be yours, nor need I cite further example than this to show what
manner of thing it is, for we unquestionably perceive your aspect
to be most agreeable and pleasing to everyone, albeit the lineaments
of it are not very delicate. Still it is of a manly cast and
at the same time full of grace; and this characteristic is to be
found in many different types of countenance. And of such sort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>I would have our Courtier’s aspect; not so soft and effeminate
as is sought by many, who not only curl their hair and pluck
their brows, but gloss their faces with all those arts employed by
the most wanton and unchaste women in the world; and in their
walk, posture and every act, they seem so limp and languid that
their limbs are like to fall apart; and they pronounce their words
so mournfully that they appear about to expire upon the spot:
and the more they find themselves with men of rank, the more
they affect such tricks. Since nature has not made them women,
as they seem to wish to appear and be, they should be treated
not as good women but as public harlots, and driven not merely
from the courts of great lords but from the society of honest men.</p>

<p class='c001'>20.—“Then coming to the bodily frame, I say it is enough if this
be neither extremely short nor tall, for both of these conditions
excite a certain contemptuous surprise, and men of either sort are
gazed upon in much the same way that we gaze on monsters.
Yet if we must offend in one of the two extremes, it is preferable
to fall a little short of the just measure of height than to exceed
it, for besides often being dull of intellect, men thus huge of body
are also unfit for every exercise of agility, which thing I should
much wish in the Courtier. And so I would have him well built
and shapely of limb, and would have him show strength and
lightness and suppleness, and know all bodily exercises that befit
a man of war: whereof I think the first should be to handle
every sort of weapon well on foot and on horse, to understand
the advantages of each, and especially to be familiar with those
weapons that are ordinarily used among gentlemen; for besides
the use of them in war, where such subtlety in contrivance is
perhaps not needful, there frequently arise differences between
one gentleman and another, which afterwards result in duels
often fought with such weapons as happen at the moment to be
within reach: thus knowledge of this kind is a very safe thing.
Nor am I one of those who say that skill is forgotten in the hour
of need; for he whose skill forsakes him at such a time, indeed
gives token that he has already lost heart and head through fear.</p>

<p class='c001'>21.—“Moreover I deem it very important to know how to
wrestle, for it is a great help in the use of all kinds of weapons on
foot. Then, both for his own sake and for that of his friends, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>must understand the quarrels and differences that may arise, and
must be quick to seize an advantage, always showing courage
and prudence in all things.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c016'><sup>[68]</sup></a> Nor should he be too ready to fight
except when honour demands it; for besides the great danger
that the uncertainty of fate entails, he who rushes into such
affairs recklessly and without urgent cause, merits the severest
censure even though he be successful. But when he finds himself
so far engaged that he cannot withdraw without reproach,
he ought to be most deliberate, both in the preliminaries to the
duel and in the duel itself, and always show readiness and daring.
Nor must he act like some, who fritter the affair away in disputes
and controversies, and who, having the choice of weapons, select
those that neither cut nor pierce, and arm themselves as if they
were expecting a cannonade; and thinking it enough not to be
defeated, stand ever on the defensive and retreat,—showing
therein their utter cowardice. And thus they make themselves
a laughing-stock for boys, like those two men of Ancona who
fought at Perugia not long since, and made everyone laugh who
saw them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And who were they?” asked my lord Gaspar Pallavicino.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Two cousins,” replied messer Cesare.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the Count said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“In their fighting they were as like as two brothers;” and
soon continued: “Even in time of peace weapons are often used
in various exercises, and gentlemen appear in public shows before
the people and ladies and great lords. For this reason I
would have our Courtier a perfect horseman in every kind of
seat; and besides understanding horses and what pertains to
riding, I would have him use all possible care and diligence to
lift himself a little beyond the rest in everything, so that he may
be ever recognized as eminent above all others. And as we read
of Alcibiades that he surpassed all the nations with whom he
lived, each in their particular province, so I would have this
Courtier of ours excel all others, and each in that which is most
their profession. And as it is the especial pride of the Italians
to ride well with the rein, to govern wild horses with consummate
skill, and to play at tilting and jousting,—in these things
let him be among the best of the Italians. In tourneys and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>the arts of defence and attack, let him shine among the best in
France.<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c016'><sup>[69]</sup></a> In stick-throwing, bull-fighting, and in casting spears
and darts, let him excel among the Spaniards. But above everything
he should temper all his movements with a certain good
judgment and grace, if he wishes to merit that universal favour
which is so greatly prized.</p>

<p class='c001'>22.—“There are also many other exercises, which although
not immediately dependent upon arms, yet are closely connected
therewith, and greatly foster manly sturdiness; and one of the
chief among these seems to me to be the chase, because it bears
a certain likeness to war: and truly it is an amusement for great
lords and befitting a man at court, and furthermore it is seen to
have been much cultivated among the ancients. It is fitting also
to know how to swim, to leap, to run, to throw stones, for besides
the use that may be made of this in war, a man often has occasion
to show what he can do in such matters; whence good esteem is
to be won, especially with the multitude, who must be taken into
account withal. Another admirable exercise, and one very befitting
a man at court, is the game of tennis, in which are well
shown the disposition of the body, the quickness and suppleness
of every member, and all those qualities that are seen in nearly
every other exercise. Nor less highly do I esteem vaulting on
horse, which although it be fatiguing and difficult, makes a man
very light and dexterous more than any other thing; and besides
its utility, if this lightness is accompanied by grace, it is to my
thinking a finer show than any of the others.<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c016'><sup>[70]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Our Courtier having once become more than fairly expert in
these exercises, I think he should leave the others on one side:
such as turning summersaults, rope-walking, and the like, which
savour of the mountebank and little befit a gentleman.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But since one cannot devote himself to such fatiguing exercises
continually, and since repetition becomes very tiresome
and abates the admiration felt for what is rare, we must
always diversify our life with various occupations. For this
reason I would have our Courtier sometimes descend to
quieter and more tranquil exercises, and in order to escape
envy and to entertain himself agreeably with everyone, let him
do whatever others do, yet never departing from praiseworthy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>deeds, and governing himself with that good judgment which
will keep him from all folly; but let him laugh, jest, banter,
frolic and dance, yet in such fashion that he shall always appear
genial and discreet, and that everything he may do or say shall
be stamped with grace.”</p>

<p class='c001'>23.—Then messer Cesare Gonzaga said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“We certainly ought on no account to hinder the course of
this discussion; but if I were to keep silence, I should be neglectful
both of the right I have to speak and of my desire to know one
thing: and let me be pardoned if I ask a question instead of contradicting;
for this I think may be permitted me, after the precedent
of messer Bernardo here, who in his over desire to be held
comely, broke the rules of our game by asking a question instead
of contradicting.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lady Duchess said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You see how one errour begets many. Therefore he who
transgresses and sets a bad example, like messer Bernardo,
deserves to be punished not only for his own transgression but
also for the others’.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Cesare replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“In that case, my Lady, I shall be exempt from penalty, since
messer Bernardo is to be punished for his own fault as well as
mine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay,” said my lady Duchess, “you both ought to have double
punishment: he for his own transgression and for leading
you to transgress; you for your own transgression and for imitating
him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lady,” replied messer Cesare, “as yet I have not transgressed;
so, to leave all this punishment to messer Bernardo
alone, I will keep silence.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And indeed he remained silent; when my lady Emilia laughed
and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Say whatever you like, for under leave of my lady Duchess
I pardon him that has transgressed and him that shall transgress,
in so small a degree.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I consent,” continued my lady Duchess. “But take care lest
perchance you fall into the mistake of thinking to gain more by
being merciful than by being just; for to pardon him too easily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>that has transgressed is to wrong him that transgresses not.
Yet I would not have my severity reproach your indulgence,
and thus be the cause of our not hearing this question of messer
Cesare.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And so, being given the signal by my lady Duchess and by my
lady Emilia, he at once said:</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec1.24'></a>24.—“If I remember rightly, Sir Count, I think you have
repeated several times this evening that the Courtier must accompany
his actions, gestures, habits, in short his every movement,
with grace; and this you seem to regard as an universal
seasoning, without which all other properties and good qualities
are of little worth. And indeed I think that in this everyone
would allow himself to be persuaded easily, since from the very
force of the word, it may be said that he who has grace finds
grace.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c016'><sup>[71]</sup></a> But since you said that this is oftentimes the gift of
nature and of heaven and, even when not thus perfect, can with
care and pains be made much greater,—those men who are
born so fortunate and so rich in this treasure as are some we
see, seem to me in this to have little need of other master; because
that benign favour of heaven almost in despite of themselves
leads them higher than they will, and makes them not
only pleasing but admirable to all the world. Therefore I do
not discuss this, it not being in our power to acquire it of ourselves.
But they who have received from nature only so much,
that they are capable of becoming graceful by pains, industry
and care,—I long to know by what art, by what training, by
what method, they can acquire this grace, as well in bodily
exercises (in which you esteem it to be so necessary) as also in
everything else that they may do or say. Therefore, since by
much praise of this quality you have aroused in all of us, I
think, an ardent thirst to pursue it, you are further bound, by the
charge that my lady Emilia laid upon you, to satisfy that thirst
by teaching us how to attain it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>25.—“I am not bound,” said the Count, “to teach you how
to become graceful, or anything else; but only to show you
what manner of man a perfect Courtier ought to be. Nor would
I in any case undertake the task of teaching you this perfection;
especially having said a little while ago that the Courtier must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>know how to wrestle, vault, and do many other things, which I
am sure you all know quite as well as if I, who have never
learned them, were to teach you. For just as a good soldier
knows how to tell the smith what fashion, shape and quality his
armour ought to have, but cannot show how it is to be made or
forged or tempered; so I perhaps may be able to tell you what
manner of man a perfect Courtier ought to be, but cannot teach
you what you must do to become one.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yet to comply with your request as far as is within my
power,—although it is almost a proverb that grace is not to be
learned,—I say that whoever would acquire grace in bodily
exercises (assuming first that he be by nature not incapable),
ought to begin early and learn the rudiments from the best
masters. And how important this seemed to King Philip of
Macedon, may be seen from the fact that he chose Aristotle, the
famous philosopher and perhaps the greatest that has ever been
in the world, to teach his son Alexander the first elements of letters.
And of the men whom we know at the present day, consider
how well and how gracefully my lord Galeazzo Sanseverino,<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c016'><sup>[72]</sup></a>
Grand Equerry of France, performs all bodily exercises;
and this because in addition to the natural aptitude of person
that he possesses, he has taken the utmost pains to study with
good masters, and always to have about him men who excel
and to select from each the best of what they know: for just as
in wrestling, vaulting and in the use of many sorts of weapons,
he has taken for his guide our friend messer Pietro Monte, who
(as you know) is the true and only master of every form of
trained strength and agility,—so in riding, jousting and all else,
he has ever had before his eyes the most proficient men that
were known in those matters.</p>

<p class='c004'>Reduced from Anderson’s photograph (no. 11129) of an anonymous and unfinished portrait
in the Ambrosiana Gallery at Milan. By some critics attributed to Leonardo da
Vinci, and by others to his pupil Ambrogio da Predis, the picture was by Morelli
regarded as having nothing to do with either painter. It was formerly supposed to be
a portrait of Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan; for iconographical identification, see Paul
Müller-Walde’s article in the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Jahrbuch der Königlich Preussischen Kunstsammlungen</cite></span>
for 1897, p. 110.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>26.—“Therefore he who wishes to be a good pupil, besides
performing his tasks well, must put forth every effort to resemble
his master, and, if it were possible, to transform himself into
his master. And when he feels that he has made some progress,
it will be very profitable to observe different men of the same
calling, and governing himself with that good judgment which
must ever be his guide, to go about selecting now this thing
from one and that thing from another. And as the bee in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>green meadows is ever wont to rob the flowers among the
grass, so our Courtier must steal this grace from all who
seem to possess it, taking from each that part which shall most
be worthy praise; and not act like a friend of ours whom you all
know, who thought he greatly resembled King Ferdinand the
Younger<a href='#f32' class='c016'><sup>[32]</sup></a> of Aragon, and made it his care to imitate the latter
in nothing but a certain trick of continually raising the head
and twisting one side of the mouth, which the king had contracted
from some infirmity. And there are many such, who
think they gain a point if only they be like a great man in some
thing; and frequently they devote themselves to that which is
his only fault.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But having before now often considered whence this grace
springs, laying aside those men who have it by nature, I find one
universal rule concerning it, which seems to me worth more in
this matter than any other in all things human that are done or
said: and that is to avoid affectation to the uttermost and as it
were a very sharp and dangerous rock; and, to use possibly a
new word, to practise in everything a certain nonchalance<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c016'><sup>[73]</sup></a> that
shall conceal design and show that what is done and said is done
without effort and almost without thought. From this I believe
grace is in large measure derived, because everyone knows the
difficulty of those things that are rare and well done, and therefore
facility in them excites the highest admiration; while on the
other hand, to strive and as the saying is to drag by the hair, is
extremely ungraceful, and makes us esteem everything slightly,
however great it be.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Accordingly we may affirm that to be true art which does
not appear to be art; nor to anything must we give greater care
than to conceal art, for if it is discovered, it quite destroys our
credit and brings us into small esteem. And I remember having
once read that there were several very excellent orators of antiquity,
who among their other devices strove to make everyone
believe that they had no knowledge of letters; and hiding their
knowledge they pretended that their orations were composed
very simply and as if springing rather from nature and truth
than from study and art; the which, if it had been detected,
would have made men wary of being duped by it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>“Thus you see how the exhibition of art and study so intense
destroys the grace in everything. Which of you is there who
does not laugh when our friend messer Pierpaolo dances in his
peculiar way, with those capers of his,—legs stiff to the toe and
head motionless, as if he were a stick, and with such intentness
that he actually seems to be counting the steps? What eye so
blind as not to see in this the ungracefulness of affectation,—and
in many men and women who are here present, the grace of
that nonchalant ease (for in the case of bodily movements many
call it thus), showing by word or laugh or gesture that they have
no care and are thinking more of everything else than of that, to
make the onlooker think they can hardly go amiss?”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec1.27'></a>27.—Messer Bernardo Bibbiena here said, without waiting:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now at last our friend messer Roberto[<a href='#f48'>48</a>] has found someone
to praise the manner of his dancing, as all the rest of you seem
to value it lightly; because if this merit consists in nonchalance,
and in appearing to take no heed and to be thinking more of
everything else than of what you are doing, messer Roberto in
dancing has no peer on earth; for to show plainly that he is not
thinking about it, he often lets the cloak drop from his shoulders
and the slippers from his feet, and still goes on dancing without
picking up either the one or the other.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the Count replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Since you insist on my talking, I will speak further of our
faults. Do you not perceive that what you call nonchalance in
messer Roberto, is really affectation? For it is clearly seen that
he is striving with all his might to seem to be taking no thought,
and this is taking too much thought; and since it passes the true
limits of moderation, his nonchalance is affected and unbecoming;
and it is a thing that works precisely the reverse of the
effect intended, that is the concealment of art. Thus in nonchalance
(which is praiseworthy in itself), I do not think that it
is less a vice of affectation to let the clothes fall from one’s back,
than in care of dress (which also is praiseworthy in itself) to
hold the head stiff for fear of disarranging one’s locks, or to
carry a mirrour in the peak of one’s cap and a comb in one’s
sleeve, and to have a valet follow one about the streets with
sponge and brush: for such care in dress and such nonchalance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>both touch upon excess, which is always offensive and contrary
to that pure and charming simplicity which is so pleasing to the
human mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You see how ungraceful a rider is who strives to sit bolt upright
in the saddle after the manner we are wont to call Venetian,<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c016'><sup>[74]</sup></a>—as
compared with another who seems not to be thinking
about it, and sits his horse as free and steady as if he were afoot.
How much more pleasing and how much more praised is a
gentleman who carries arms, if he be modest, speak little and
boast little, than another who is forever sounding his own
praises, and with blasphemy and bluster seems to be hurling
defiance at the world! This too is naught but affectation of
wishing to appear bold. And so it is with every exercise, nay
with everything that can be done or said in the world.”</p>

<p class='c001'>28.—Then my lord Magnifico<a href='#f9' class='c016'><sup>[9]</sup></a> said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is true also with music, wherein it is a very great fault
to place two perfect consonances one after the other, so that our
very sense of hearing abhors it and often enjoys a second or
seventh, which in itself is a harsh and intolerable discord. And
the reason is that repetition of perfect consonances begets
satiety and exhibits a too affected harmony; which is avoided
by introducing imperfect consonances, and thus a kind of contrast
is given, whereby our ears are held more in suspense, and
more eagerly await and enjoy the perfect consonances, and
sometimes delight in that discord of the second or seventh, as in
something unpremeditated.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You see then,” replied the Count, “the harmful effect of
affectation in this as in other things. It is said also to have
been proverbial among some very excellent painters of antiquity,
that over diligence is harmful, and Protogenes is said
to have been censured by Apelles because he did not know
when to take his hand from the tablet.”<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c016'><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Cesare said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Methinks our friend fra Serafino has this same fault, of not
knowing when to take his hands from the table, at least until all
the food has been taken from it too.”<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c016'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Count laughed, and continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Apelles meant that in his painting Protogenes did not know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>when he had finished, which was the same thing as reproving
him for being affected in his work. Thus this excellence, which
is the opposite of affectation and which for the present we call
nonchalance, besides being the true fountain from which grace
springs, carries with it another ornament, which, in accompanying
any human action whatever and however trifling it be, not
only at once reveals the knowledge of him who performs it, but
often leads us to rate his knowledge as much greater than in fact
it is; because it impresses upon the minds of the bystanders the
idea that he who does well so easily, knows much more than he
does, and that if he were to use care and effort in what he did,
he could do it far better.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And to multiply like examples, here is a man who handles
weapons, either about to throw a dart or holding a sword in his
hand or other weapon; if he nimbly and without thinking puts
himself in an attitude of readiness, with such ease that his body
and all his members seem to fall into that posture naturally and
quite without effort,—although he do no more, he will prove himself
to everyone to be perfect in that exercise. Likewise in dancing,
a single step, a single movement of the person that is graceful
and not forced, soon shows the knowledge of the dancer. A
musician who in singing utters a single note ending with sweet
tone in a little group of four notes with such ease as to seem
spontaneous, shows by that single touch that he can do much
more than he is doing. Often too in painting, a single line not
laboured, a single brush-stroke easily drawn, so that it seems as
if the hand moves unbidden to its aim according to the painter’s
wish, without being guided by care or any skill, clearly reveals
the excellence of the craftsman, which every man appreciates
according to his capacity for judging. And the same is true of
nearly everything else.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Our Courtier then will be esteemed excellent and will attain
grace in everything, particularly in speaking, if he avoids affectation;
into which fault many fall, and often more than others,
some of us Lombards; who, if they have been a year away from
home, on their return at once begin to speak Roman, sometimes
Spanish or French, and God knows how. And all this comes
from over zeal to appear widely informed; in such fashion do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>men devote care and assiduity to acquiring a very odious fault.
And truly it would be no light task for me, if I were to try in
these discussions of ours to use those antique Tuscan words that
are quite rejected by the usage of the Tuscans of to-day; and
besides I think everyone would laugh at me.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec1.29'></a>29.—Then messer Federico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of course in discussing among ourselves as we now are
doing, perhaps it would be amiss to use those antique Tuscan
words, since (as you say) they would be fatiguing to him who
uttered them and to him who listened to them, and by many
would not be understood without difficulty. But if one were
writing, I should certainly think he would be wrong not to use
them, because they add much grace and authority to writing,
and from them there results a style more grave and full of
majesty than from modern words.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not know,” replied the Count, “that writings can gain
grace and authority from those words that ought to be avoided,
not merely in such talk as we are now engaged in (which you
yourself admit), but also under every other circumstance that
can be imagined. For if any man of good judgment should
chance to make a speech on serious matters before the very
senate of Florence, which is the capital of Tuscany, or even to
converse privately with a person of weight in that city about
important business, or with his closest friend about affairs of
pleasure, with ladies or gentlemen about love, or joking or jesting
at feasts, games, and where you will,—or whatever the time,
place or matter,—I am sure he would avoid using those antique
Tuscan words; and if he did use them, besides exciting ridicule,
he would give no little annoyance to everyone who listened to
him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It seems to me then a very strange thing to use as good in
writing those words that are avoided as faulty in every sort of
speaking, and to insist that what is never proper in speaking, is
the most proper style that can be used in writing. For in my
opinion writing is really nothing but a form of speech, which
still remains after we have spoken, as it were an image or rather
the life of our words: and thus in speech, which is lost as soon
as the sound has gone forth, some things are bearable perhaps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>that are not in writing, because writing preserves the words and
subjects them to the judgment of the reader and gives time to
consider them advisedly. Hence in writing it is reasonable
to take greater pains to make it more refined and correct; not
however in such wise that the written words may be unlike the
spoken, but that, in writing, choice be made of the most beautiful
that are used in speaking. And if that were allowed in writing
which is not allowed in speaking, I think a very great inconvenience
would arise: which is that greater license could be taken
in that respect wherein greater care ought to be taken; and the
industry bestowed on writing would work harm instead of good.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore it is certain that what is proper in writing, is
proper also in speaking, and that manner of speaking is most
beautiful which is like beautiful writing. Moreover I think it is
far more necessary to be understood in writing than in speaking,
because those who write are not always present before those
who read, as those who speak are present before those who
<a id='corr40.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='speak'>hear</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_40.18'><ins class='correction' title='speak'>hear</ins></a></span>.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c016'><sup>[77]</sup></a> But I should praise him, who besides avoiding many
antique Tuscan words, acquired facility, both writing and speaking,
in the use of those that are to-day familiar in Tuscany and
in the other parts of Italy, and that have comeliness of sound.
And I think that whoever imposes other rule upon himself, is not
very sure of escaping that affectation which is so much censured
and of which we were speaking earlier.”</p>

<p class='c001'>30.—Then messer Federico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sir Count, I cannot gainsay you that writing is a kind of
speech. Indeed, I say that if words that are spoken have any
obscurity in them, the meaning does not penetrate the mind of
him who hears, and passing without being understood, comes to
naught: which does not occur in writing, because if the words
that the writer uses carry with them a little, I will not say difficulty,
but subtlety that is recondite and thus not so familiar as
are the words that are commonly used in speaking,—they give a
certain greater authority to the writing, and cause the reader to
proceed more cautiously and collectedly, to consider more, and
to enjoy the genius and learning of him who writes; and by
judiciously exerting himself a little, he tastes that delight which
is found in the pursuit of difficult things. And if the ignorance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>of him who reads is so great that he cannot overcome those difficulties,
it is not the fault of the writer, nor on this account ought
that style to be deemed unbeautiful.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore in writing, I believe it is proper to use Tuscan
words used only by the ancient Tuscans, because that is great
proof and tested by time, that they are good and effective to
express the sense in which they are used. And besides this,
they have that grace and venerableness which age lends not
only to words, but to buildings, to statues, to pictures, and to
everything that is able to attain it, and often merely by their
splendour and dignity they make diction beautiful, by virtue
whereof (and of grace) every theme, however mean it be, can be
so adorned as to merit very high praise. But this custom of
yours, by which you set such store, seems to me very dangerous,
and often it may be bad; and if some fault of speech is found
widely prevalent among the ignorant many, methinks it ought
not on this account to be taken as a rule and followed by other
men. Moreover customs are very diverse, nor is there a noble
city of Italy that has not a different manner of speaking from all
the others. But as you do not limit yourself to declaring which
is the best, a man might as well adopt the Bergamasque as the
Florentine, and according to you it would be no errour.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c016'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore I think that whoever wishes to avoid all doubt
and be quite safe, must needs select as model someone who by
consent of all is rated good, and must take him as a constant
guide and shield against any possible adverse critic. And this
model (in the vernacular, I mean) I do not think should be other
than Petrarch<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c016'><sup>[79]</sup></a> and Boccaccio; and whoever departs from
these two, gropes like one who walks in the dark without a light
and thus often mistakes the road. But we are so daring that
we do not deign to do that which the good writers of old did,—that
is, devote themselves to imitation, without which I think a
man cannot write well.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c016'><sup>[80]</sup></a> And methinks good proof of this is
shown us by Virgil, who by his genius and judgment so divine
took from all posterity the hope of ever being able to imitate
him well, yet fain would imitate Homer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>31.—Then my lord Gaspar Pallavicino said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“This discussion about writing is certainly well worth listening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>to: still it would be more to our purpose if you were to
teach us in what manner the Courtier ought to speak, for I
think he has greater need of it and more often has occasion to
employ speaking than writing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, for a Courtier so excellent and so perfect there is no
doubt but it is necessary to know both the one and the other,
and that without these two accomplishments perhaps all the
rest would not be very worthy of praise. So if the Count wishes
to perform his duty, he will teach the Courtier not only how to
speak, but also how to write well.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the Count said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My lord Magnifico, that task I will on no account accept; for
great folly would be mine to pretend to teach others that which
I do not myself know, and (even if I did know it) to think myself
able to do in only a few words that which with so much care
and pains has hardly been done by most learned men,—to whose
works I should refer our Courtier, if I were indeed bound to
teach him how to write and speak.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Cesare said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My lord Magnifico means speaking and writing the vernacular
[Italian], and not Latin; so those works by learned men are
not to our purpose. But in this matter there is need for you to
tell us what you know about it, because for the rest we will hold
you excused.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Count replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have told you that already; but as we are speaking of the
Tuscan tongue, perhaps it would be, more than any other man’s,
my lord Magnifico’s office to give an opinion on it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I cannot and in reason ought not to contradict any man who
says that the Tuscan tongue is more beautiful than the others.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c016'><sup>[81]</sup></a>
It is very true that in Petrarch and in Boccaccio are found many
words that are now discarded by the custom of to-day; and
these I for my part would never use either in speaking or in
writing; and I believe that they themselves, if they had survived
until now, would no longer use those words.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Federico said:</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>“Indeed they would. And you Tuscan gentlemen ought to
keep up your mother tongue, and not suffer it to decay, as you
do,—so that now one may say that there is less knowledge of it
in Florence than in many other parts of Italy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Bernardo said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“These words that are no longer used in Florence have survived
among the country folk, and are rejected by the gentle as
corrupt and spoiled with age.”</p>

<p class='c001'>32.—Then my lady Duchess said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let us not wander from our main purpose, but have Count
Ludovico teach the Courtier how to speak and write well, whether
it be in the Tuscan or any other dialect.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lady,” replied the Count, “I have already told what I
know about it; and I hold that the same rules which serve to
teach the one, serve also to teach the other. But since you
require it of me, I will make such response as I may to messer
Federico, who has a different opinion from mine; and perhaps I
shall have need to discuss the matter somewhat more diffusely
than is right. However, it shall be all I can tell.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And first I say that in my judgment this language of ours,
which we call vulgar, is still tender and new, although it be
already long in use. For since Italy was not only vexed and
ravaged but long inhabited by the barbarians, the Latin language
was corrupted and spoiled by contact with those nations,
and from that corruption other languages were born: and like
rivers that from the crest of the Apennines separate and flow
down into the two seas, so also these languages divided, and
some of them tinged with Latinity reached by diverse paths, one
this country and one that; and one of them remained in Italy
tinged with barbarism. Thus our language was long unformed
and various, from having had no one to bestow care upon
it or write in it or try to give it splendour or grace: but afterwards
it was somewhat more cultivated in Tuscany than in
the other parts of Italy. And so its flower seems to have remained
there even from those early times, because that nation
more than the others preserved a sweet accent and a proper
grammatical order, and have had three noble writers<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c016'><sup>[82]</sup></a> who
expressed their thoughts ingeniously and in those words and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>terms that the custom of their times permitted: wherein I think
Petrarch succeeded more happily than the others in amourous
subjects.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Afterwards from time to time, not only in Tuscany but in all
Italy, among noble men and those well versed in courts and
arms and letters, there arose some desire to speak and write
more elegantly than had been done in that rude and uncultivated
age, when the blaze of the calamities inflicted by the barbarians
was not yet quenched. Many words were laid aside, as well in
the city of Florence itself and in all Tuscany as in the rest of
Italy, and instead of them others were taken up; and herein
there thus occurred that change which takes place in all human
affairs and has always happened in the case of the other languages
also. For if those earliest writings in ancient Latin had
survived until now, we should see that Evander and Turnus<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c016'><sup>[83]</sup></a>
and the other Latins of that age spoke differently from the last
Roman kings and the first consuls. See how the verses that the
Salian priests chaunted were hardly understood by posterity;<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c016'><sup>[84]</sup></a>
but being established in that form by the first founders, out
of religious reverence they were not changed. Likewise the
orators and poets continued one after another to lay aside many
words used by their predecessors: thus Antonius, Crassus,
Hortensius and Cicero avoided many of Cato’s words, and Virgil
avoided many of Ennius’s;<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c016'><sup>[85]</sup></a> and the others did the same.
For although they had reverence for antiquity, yet they did not
esteem it so highly as to consent to be bound by it in the way you
would have us bound by it now. Nay they criticised it where
they saw fit, as did Horace, who says that his forefathers lauded
Plautus foolishly, and thinks he has a right to gather in new
words.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c016'><sup>[86]</sup></a> And in sundry places Cicero reprehends many of his
predecessors, and slightingly affirms that Sergius Galba’s orations
had an antique flavour,<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c016'><sup>[87]</sup></a> and says that Ennius himself disprized
his predecessors in certain things: so that if we would
imitate the ancients, in doing so we shall not imitate them. And
Virgil, who (you say) imitated Homer, did not imitate him in
language.</p>

<p class='c001'>33.—“Therefore I for my part should always avoid using
these antique words, save however in certain places, and seldom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>even there; and it seems to me that whoever uses them otherwise
makes a mistake, not less than he who, in order to imitate
the ancients, should wish to feed on acorns when wheat had
been discovered in plenty. And since you say that by their
mere splendour of antiquity, antique words so adorn every subject,
however mean it be, that they can make it worthy of much
praise,—I say that I do not set such store, not only by these antique
words but even by good ones, as to think that they ought
in reason to be prized without the pith of beautiful thoughts; for
to divide thought from words is to divide soul from body, which
can be done in neither case without destruction.</p>

<p class='c001'>“So I think that what is chiefly important and necessary for
the Courtier, in order to speak and write well, is knowledge; for
he who is ignorant and has nothing in his mind that merits
being heard, can neither say it nor write it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Next he must arrange in good order what he has to say or
write; then express it well in words, which (if I do not err)
ought to be precise, choice, rich and rightly formed, but above
all, in use even among the masses; because such words as these
make the grandeur and pomp of speech, if the speaker has good
sense and carefulness, and knows how to choose the words most
expressive of his meaning, and to exalt them, to mould them
like wax to his will, and to arrange them in such position and
order that they shall at a glance show and make known their
dignity and splendour, like pictures placed in good and proper
light.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And this I say as well of writing as of speaking: in which
however some things are required that are not needful in
writing,—such as a good voice, not too thin and soft like a
woman’s, nor yet so stern and rough as to smack of the rustic’s,—but
sonorous, clear, sweet and well sounding, with distinct enunciation,
and with proper bearing and gestures; which I think
consist in certain movements of the whole body, not affected or
violent, but tempered by a calm face and with a play of the eyes
that shall give an effect of grace, accord with the words, and as
far as possible express also, together with the gestures, the
speaker’s intent and feeling.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But all these things would be vain and of small moment, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the thoughts expressed by the words were not beautiful, ingenious,
acute, elegant and grave,—according to the need.”</p>

<p class='c001'>34.—Then my lord Morello said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“If this Courtier speaks with so much elegance and grace, I
doubt if anyone will be found among us who will understand
him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, he will be understood by everyone,” replied the Count,
“because facility is no impediment to elegance.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nor would I have him speak always of grave matters, but of
amusing things, of games, jests and waggery, according to the
occasion; but sensibly of everything, and with readiness and
lucid fullness; and in no place let him show vanity or childish
folly. And again when he is speaking on an obscure or difficult
subject, I would have him carefully explain his meaning with
precision of both word and thought, and make every ambiguity
clear and plain with a certain touch of unpedantic care. Likewise,
where there is occasion, let him know how to speak with
dignity and force, to arouse those emotions that are part of our
nature, and to kindle them or to move them according to the
need. Sometimes, with that simple candour that makes it seem
as if nature herself were speaking, let him know how to soften
them, and as it were to intoxicate them with sweetness, and so
easily withal that the listener shall think that with very little
effort he too could reach that excellence, and when he tries,
shall find himself very far behind.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In such fashion would I have our Courtier speak and write;
and not only choose rich and elegant words from every part of
Italy, but I should even praise him for sometimes using some
of those French and Spanish terms that are already accepted by
our custom.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c016'><sup>[88]</sup></a> Thus it would not displease me if on occasion he
were to say, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>primor</i></span> (excellence); or <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>acertare</i></span> (to succeed),
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>aventurare</i></span> (to run a risk successfully); or <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>ripassare una persona
con ragionamento</i></span>, meaning to sound a person and to talk with
him in order to gain perfect knowledge of him; or <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>un cavalier
senza rimproccio</i></span> (a cavalier without reproach), <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>attilato</i></span> (elegant),
<i>creato d’un principe</i> (a prince’s creature), and other like terms,
provided he might hope to be understood.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c016'><sup>[89]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Sometimes I would have him use a few words in a sense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>other than that proper to them, to transpose them aptly, and as
it were to graft them, like the branch of a tree, upon a more
appropriate trunk,—so as to make them more attractive and
beautiful, and as it were to bring things within the range of our
vision, and within hand-touch as we say, to the delight of him
who hears or reads. Nor would I have him scruple to form
new words and in new figures of speech, deriving them tastefully
from the Latins, as of old the Latins derived them from
the Greeks.</p>

<p class='c001'>35.—“Now if among the lettered men of good talent and
judgment who to-day are found in our midst, there were a
few who would take care to write in this language (as I have
described) things worthy of being read, we should soon see it
studied and abounding in beautiful terms and figures, and capable
of being written in as well as is any other whatsoever; and
if it were not pure old Tuscan, it would be Italian,—universal,
copious and varied, and in a way like a delightful garden full of
various flowers and fruits. Nor would this be a novel thing; for
from the four dialects that the Greek writers had in use,<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c016'><sup>[90]</sup></a> they
culled words, forms and figures from each as they saw fit, and
thence they brought forth another dialect which was called
‘common,’ and later they called all five by the single name
Greek. And although the Attic dialect was more elegant, pure
and copious than the others, good writers who were not Athenians
by birth did not so affect it as to be unrecognizable by their
style and by the perfume (as it were) and essence of their native
speech. Nor yet were they disprized for this; on the contrary
those who tried to seem too Athenian, were censured for it.
Among the Latin writers too, many non-Romans were highly
esteemed in their day, although there was not found in
them that typical purity of the Roman tongue which men of
other race can rarely acquire. Thus Titus Livius was not at
all discarded, although someone professed to have detected a
Paduan flavour in him;<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c016'><sup>[91]</sup></a> nor was Virgil, albeit reproached with
not speaking Roman. Moreover, as you know, many writers of
barbarian race were read and esteemed at Rome.</p>

<p class='c001'>“We, on the contrary, much more strict than the ancients,
needlessly impose certain new laws upon ourselves, and with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>beaten highways before our eyes, we seek to go along the by-paths;
for in our own language,—of which, as of all others, the
office is to express thought well and clearly,—we delight ourselves
with obscurity; and calling it the vulgar tongue, we try in
speaking it to use words that are understood neither by the vulgar
nor yet by the gentle and lettered, and are no longer used in
any place; unmindful that all the good writers of old disapproved
words discarded by custom. Which to my thinking, you do not
rightly understand; since you say that if some fault of speech is
widely prevalent among the ignorant, it ought not for that reason
to be called custom or accepted as a rule of speech, and from
what I have heard you sometimes say, you would have us use
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Campidoglio</i></span> in place of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Capitolio</i></span>; <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Girolamo</i></span> for <i>Hieronymo</i>; <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>aldace</i></span>
for <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>audace</i></span>; and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>padrone</i></span> for <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>patrone</i></span>, and other words corrupt
and spoiled like these; because they are found written thus by
some ignorant old Tuscan, and because the Tuscan country folk
speak thus to-day.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c016'><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Hence I believe that good custom in speech springs from men
who have talent and who have gained good judgment from study
and experience, and who therefore agree and consent to accept
the words that to them seem good, which are recognized by a
certain innate judgment and not by any art or rule. Do you not
know that figures of speech, which give so much grace and
splendour to an oration, are all infringements of grammatical
rules, yet accepted and confirmed by usage, because, although
unable to offer other reason, they give pleasure and seem to carry
suavity and sweetness to our very sense of hearing? And this I
believe to be good custom,—of which the Romans, the Neapolitans,
the Lombards and the rest, may be as capable as the
Tuscans are.</p>

<p class='c001'>36.—“It is very true that in every language certain things
are always good, such as ease, good order, richness, beautiful
sentences, harmonious periods; and on the contrary affectation
and other things opposed to these, are bad. But among words
there are some that remain good for a time, then grow antiquated
and wholly lose their grace; others gain strength and come to
be esteemed. For as the seasons of the year despoil the earth
of flowers and fruits and then clothe it anew with others, so time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>causes those primal words to decay, and use makes others to be
born again and gives them grace and dignity, until they in their
turn meet their death, consumed by the envious gnawing of time;
for in the end both we and all our concerns are mortal. Consider
that we no longer have any knowledge of the Oscan
tongue.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c016'><sup>[93]</sup></a> The Provençal, although it may be said to have been
but lately celebrated by noble writers, is not now understood by
the inhabitants of that country. Hence I think, as my lord
Magnifico has well said, that if Petrarch and Boccaccio were
alive at this time, they would not use many words that we find in
their writings: therefore it does not seem to me well for us to
copy these words. I applaud very highly those who know how
to imitate that which ought to be imitated, but I do not at all
believe that it is impossible to write well without imitating,—and
particularly in this language of ours, wherein we may be aided
by usage: which I should not dare say of Latin.”</p>

<p class='c001'>37.—The messer Federico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why would you have usage more esteemed in the vernacular
than in Latin?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay,” replied the Count, “I esteem usage as mistress of both
the one and the other. But since those men to whom the Latin
tongue was as natural as the vernacular now is to us, are no
longer on earth, we must needs learn from their writings that
which they learned from usage. Nor does ancient speech mean
anything more than ancient usage of speech, and it would be a
silly business to like ancient speech for no other reason than a
wish to speak as men used to speak rather than as they now
speak.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then,” replied messer Federico, “the ancients did not imitate?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I believe,” said the Count, “that many of them did, but not in
everything. And if Virgil had imitated Hesiod in everything, he
would not have surpassed his master; nor Cicero, Crassus; nor
Ennius, his predecessors. You know Homer is so ancient that
many believe he is the first heroic poet in time as he is also
in excellence of diction: and whom would you think he imitated?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Some other poet,” replied messer Federico, “more ancient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>than he, of whom we have no knowledge because of excessive
antiquity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then whom,” said the Count, “would you say Petrarch and
Boccaccio imitated, who were on earth only three days since, one
may say?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know not,” replied messer Federico; “but we may believe
that even their minds were directed to imitation, although we do
not know of whom.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Count replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“We may believe that they who were imitated, surpassed
those who imitated them; and if they were admirable, it would
be too great a marvel that their name and fame should be so
soon extinguished. But I believe that their real master was
aptitude and their own native judgment; and at this there is no
one who ought to wonder, since nearly always the summit of
every excellence may be approached by diverse roads. Nor is
there anything that has not in it many things of the same sort
which are dissimilar and yet intrinsically deserving of equal
praise.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Consider music, the harmonies of which are now grave and
slow, now very fast and of novel moods and means; yet all give
pleasure, albeit for different reasons: as is seen in Bidon’s<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c016'><sup>[94]</sup></a> manner
of singing, which is so skilful, ready, vehement, fervid, and
of such varied melodies, that the listener’s spirits are moved and
inflamed, and thus entranced seem to be lifted up to heaven.
Nor does our friend Marchetto Cara<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c016'><sup>[95]</sup></a> move us less by his singing,
but with a gentler harmony; because he softens and penetrates
our souls by placid means and full of plaintive sweetness,
gently stirring them to sweet emotion.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Again, various things give equal pleasure to our eyes, so that
we can with difficulty decide which are more pleasing to them.

<p class='c004'>Reduced from Anderson’s photograph (no. 8148) of a part of the fresco, “Zacharias in
the Temple,” in the Church of Santa Maria Novella at Florence, by Domenico Bigordi,
better known as Ghirlandajo, (1449-1494).</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>“It is the same with many Greek and Latin poets, who, although
different in their writing, are equal in their fame. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>orators, too, have always had so much diversity among themselves,
that almost every age has produced and prized a type of
orator peculiar to its own time; and these have been different
not only from their predecessors and successors, but from one
another: as it is written of Isocrates, Lysias, Æschines,<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c016'><sup>[101]</sup></a> and
many others among the Greeks,—all excellent, yet each resembling
no one but himself. So, among the Latins, Carbo, Lælius,
Scipio Africanus, Galba, Sulpicius, Cotta, Gracchus, Marcus
Antonius, Crassus,<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c016'><sup>[102]</sup></a> and so many others that it would be tedious
to name them,—all good and very different one from another;
so that if a man were able to consider all the orators that have
been in the world, he would find as many kinds of oratory as of
orators. I think I remember too that Cicero in a certain place<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c016'><sup>[103]</sup></a>
makes Marcus Antonius say to Sulpicius that there are many
who imitate no man and yet arrive at the highest pitch of excellence;
and he speaks of certain ones who had introduced a new
form and figure of speech, beautiful but not usual among the
orators of that time, wherein they imitated no one but themselves.
For that reason he affirms also that masters ought
to consider the pupils’ nature, and taking this as guide ought to
direct and aid them to the path towards which their aptitude
and natural disposition incline them. Hence I believe, dear
messer Federico, that if a man has no innate affinity for any
particular author, it is not well to force him to imitate, because
the vigour<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c016'><sup>[104]</sup></a> of his faculty languishes and is impeded when turned
from the channel in which it would have made progress had that
channel not been barred.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore I do not see how it can be well, instead of enriching
this language of ours and giving it spirit and grandeur and
light, to make it poor, thin, humble and obscure, and to try to
restrict it in such narrow bounds that everyone shall be forced
to imitate Petrarch and Boccaccio alone; and how, in respect of
language, we ought not also to give credence to Poliziano,<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c016'><sup>[105]</sup></a> to
Lorenzo de’ Medici,<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c016'><sup>[106]</sup></a> to Francesco Diacceto,<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c016'><sup>[107]</sup></a> and to some others
who are also Tuscans and perhaps of no less learning and judgment
than were Petrarch and Boccaccio. And great pity would
it be indeed to set a limit, and not to surpass that which almost
the earliest writers achieved, and to deny that so many men of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>such noble genius can ever find more than one beautiful form
of expression in this language which is proper and natural to
them. But to-day there are certain scrupulous souls, who so
frighten the listener with the cult and ineffable mysteries of this
Tuscan tongue of theirs, as to put even many a noble and
learned man in such fear, that he dare not open his mouth and
confesses that he does not know how to speak the very language
which he learned in swaddling clothes from his nurse.</p>

<p class='c001'>“However I think we have said only too much of this; so now
let us go on with our discussion about the Courtier.”</p>

<p class='c001'>38.—Then messer Federico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should first like to say one thing more, which is that I do
not deny men’s opinions and aptitudes to be different among
themselves. Nor do I believe that it would be well for a naturally
vehement and excitable man to set himself to write of placid
themes, or for another, being severe and grave, to write jests;
for in this matter it seems to me reasonable that everyone should
adapt himself to his own proper instinct. And I think Cicero
was speaking of this when he said that masters ought to have
regard to their pupils’ nature, in order not to act like bad husbandmen,
who will sometimes sow grain in land that is fruitful
only for the vine.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Still I cannot get it into my head why, in the case of a particular
language,—which is not proper to all men equally, like
speech and thought and many other functions, but an invention
of limited use,—it is not more rational to imitate those who speak
better, than to speak at random; or why, just as in Latin we
ought to try to approach the language of Virgil and Cicero rather
than that of Silius or Cornelius Tacitus,<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c016'><sup>[108]</sup></a> it is not better in the
vernacular also to imitate the language of Petrarch and Boccaccio
than any other’s; yet to express our thoughts in it well, and
thus to give heed to our own natural instinct, as Cicero teaches.
And in this way it will be found that the difference which you say
there is among good orators, consists in sense and not in language.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the Count said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I fear we shall be entering on a wide sea, and shall be leaving
our first subject of the Courtier. However, I ask you in what
consists the excellence of this language?”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Messer Federico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“In preserving strictly its proprieties, in giving it that sense,
and in using that style and those rhythms, which have been used
by all who have written well.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should like to know,” said the Count, “whether this style
and these rhythms of which you speak, arise from the thought or
from the words.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“From the words,” replied messer Federico.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then,” said the Count, “do not the words of Silius and Cornelius
Tacitus seem to you the same that Virgil and Cicero use? and
employed in the same sense?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly they are the same,” replied messer Federico, “but
some of them wrongly applied and turned awry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Count replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“And if from a book of Cornelius and from one of Silius, all
those words were removed that are used in a sense different from
that of Virgil and Cicero, which would be very few,—would you
not then say that Cornelius was the equal of Cicero in language,
and Silius of Virgil, and that it would be well to imitate their
manner of speech?”</p>

<p class='c001'>39.—Then my lady Emilia said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Methinks this debate of yours is far too long and tedious;
therefore it were well to postpone it to another time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Federico was about to reply none the less, but my lady
Emilia always interrupted him. At last the Count said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Many men like to pass judgment upon style and to talk about
rhythms and imitation; but they cannot make it at all clear to me
what manner of thing style or rhythm is, or in what imitation
consists, or why things taken from Homer or from someone else
are so becoming in Virgil that they seem illumined rather than
imitated. Perhaps this is because I am not capable of understanding
them; but since a good sign that a man knows a thing,
is his ability to teach it, I suspect that they too understand it but
little, and that they praise both Virgil and Cicero because they
hear such praise from many, not because they perceive the difference
that exists between these two and others: for in truth it does
not consist in preserving two or three or ten words used in a way
different from the others.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“In Sallust, Cæsar, Varro<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c016'><sup>[109]</sup></a> and the other good writers, some
terms are found used differently from the way Cicero uses them;
and yet both ways are proper, for the excellence and force of a
language lie in no such trifling matter: as Demosthenes well said
to Æschines, who tauntingly asked him whether certain words
that he had used (although not Attic) were prodigies or portents;
and Demosthenes laughed and replied that the fortunes of Greece
did not hang on such a trifle. So I too should care little if I were
reproved by a Tuscan for having said <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>satisfatto</i></span> rather than <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>sodisfatto</i></span>,
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>honorevole</i></span> for <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>horrevole</i></span>, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>causa</i></span> for <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>cagione</i></span>, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>populo</i></span> for <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>popolo</i></span>,
and the like.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Federico rose to his feet and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hear me these few words, I pray.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The pain of my displeasure,” replied my lady Emilia, laughing,
“be upon him who speaks more of this matter now, for I wish to
postpone it to another evening. But do you, Count, go on with
the discussion about the Courtier,—and show us what a fine
memory you have, which I think you will do in no small measure,
if you are able to take up the discussion where you left it.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec1.40'></a>40.—“My Lady,” replied the Count, “I fear the thread is broken;
yet if I am not wrong, methinks we were saying that the pest of
affectation imparts extreme ungracefulness to everything, while
on the other hand simplicity and nonchalance produce the height
of grace: in praise of which, and in blame of affectation, we might
cite many other arguments; but of these I wish to add only one,
and no more. Women are always very eager to be—and when
they cannot be, at least to seem—beautiful. So where nature is
somewhat at fault in this regard, they try to piece it out by artifice;
whence arise that painting of the face with so much care and
sometimes pains, that plucking of the eyebrows and forehead,
and the use of all those devices and the endurance of that trouble,
which you ladies think to keep very secret from men, but which
are all well known.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here madonna Costanza Fregosa laughed and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It would be far more courteous for you to keep to your discussion,
and tell us of what grace is born, and talk about Courtiership,—than
to try to unveil the weaknesses of women, which
are not to the purpose.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“Nay, much to the purpose,” replied the Count: “for these
weaknesses of yours I am speaking of, deprive you of grace
because they spring from nothing but affectation, wherein you
openly make known to everyone your over-eagerness to be
beautiful.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you not see how much more grace a lady has who paints
(if at all) so sparingly and so little, that whoever sees her is in
doubt whether she be painted or not; than another lady so plastered
that she seems to have put a mask upon her face and dares
not laugh for fear of cracking it, nor ever changes colour but
when she dresses in the morning, and then stands motionless all
the rest of the day like a wooden image, showing herself only
by candle-light, like wily merchants who display their cloths in a
dark place? Again, how much more pleasing than all others is
one (I mean not ill-favoured) who is plainly seen to have nothing
on her face, although it be neither very white nor very red, but
by nature a little pale and sometimes tinged with an honest flush
from shame or other accident,—with hair artlessly unadorned and
hardly confined, her gestures simple and free, without showing
care or wish to be beautiful! This is that nonchalant simplicity
most pleasing to the eyes and minds of men, who are ever fearful
of being deceived by art.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Beautiful teeth are very charming in a woman, for since they
are not so much in view as the face is, but lie hidden most of the
time, we may believe that less care is taken to make them beautiful
than with the face. Yet if one were to laugh without cause
and solely to display the teeth, he would betray his art, and however
beautiful they were, would seem most ungraceful to all, like
Catullus’s Egnatius.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c016'><sup>[110]</sup></a> It is the same with the hands; which, if
they are delicate and beautiful, and occasionally left bare when
there is need to use them, and not in order to display their beauty,
they leave a very great desire to see more of them, and especially
if covered with gloves again; for whoever covers them seems to
have little care or thought whether they be seen or not, and
to have them thus beautiful more by nature than by any effort
or pains.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have you ever noticed when a woman, in passing through
the street to church or elsewhere, thoughtlessly happens (either in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>frolic or from other cause) to lift her dress high enough to show
the foot and often a little of the leg? Does this not seem to you
full of grace, when you see her tricked out with a touch of feminine
daintiness in velvet shoes and neat stockings? I for one
delight in it and believe you all do, for everyone is persuaded
that elegance, in matters thus hidden and rarely seen, is natural
and instinctive to the lady rather than forced, and that she does
not think to win any praise by it.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec1.41'></a>41.—“In this way we avoid and hide affectation, and you can
now see how opposed and destructive it is to grace in every office
as well of the body as the mind: whereof we have thus far spoken
little, and yet we must not omit it, for since the mind is of far
more worth than the body, it deserves to be more cultivated and
adorned. And as to what ought to be done in the case of our
Courtier, we will lay aside the precepts of the many sage philosophers
who write of this matter and define the properties of the
mind and discuss so subtly about their rank,—and keeping to our
subject, we will in a few words declare it to be enough that he be
(as we say) an honest and upright man; for in this are included
prudence, goodness, strength and temperance of mind, and all
the other qualities that are proper to a name so honoured. And
I esteem him alone to be a true moral philosopher, who wishes to
be good; and in this regard he needs few other precepts than
that wish. And therefore Socrates was right in saying that he
thought his teachings bore good fruit indeed whenever they
incited anyone to understand and teach virtue: for they who
have reached the goal of desiring nothing more ardently than to
be good, easily acquire knowledge of everything needful therefor;
so we will discuss this no further.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec1.42'></a>42.—“Yet besides goodness, I think that letters are for everyone
the true and principal ornament of the mind: although the
French recognize only the nobility of arms and esteem all else
as naught. Thus they not only fail to prize but they abhor
letters, and hold all men of letters most base, and think they
speak very basely of any man when they call him a clerk.”</p>

<p>MONSEIGNEUR D’ANGOULÊME<br />AFTERWARD FRANCIS I OF FRANCE<br />1494-1547</p>

</div>
<p class='c004'>Enlarged from a negative, specially made by Alinari through the courtesy of Professor
I. B. Supino, of an anonymous medal in the National Museum at Florence.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Then the Magnifico Giuliano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You say truly, that this fault has long been prevalent among
the French. But if kind fate decrees that Monseigneur d’Angoulême<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c016'><sup>[111]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>shall succeed to the crown, as is hoped, I think that
just as the glory of arms flourishes and shines in France, so too
ought that of letters to flourish in highest state; for it is not long
since I, being at the court, saw this prince, and it seemed to me
that besides the grace of his person and the beauty of his face,
he had in his aspect such loftiness, joined however with a certain
gracious humanity, that the realm of France must always
seem small for him. I heard afterwards from many gentlemen,
both French and Italian, of his very noble manner of life, of his
loftiness of mind, of his valour and liberality. And among other
things I was told that he loved and esteemed letters especially
and held all men of letters in greatest honour; and he condemned
the French themselves for being so hostile to this profession,
especially as they have within their borders such a
noble school as that of Paris, frequented by all the world.”<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c016'><sup>[112]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Then the Count said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is a great marvel that in such tender youth, solely by
natural instinct and against the usage of his country, he has of
himself chosen so worthy a path. And as subjects always copy
the customs of their superiours, it may be that, as you say, the
French will yet come to esteem letters at their true worth:
whereto they may easily be persuaded, if they will but listen to
reason; since nothing is by nature more desirable for men, or
more proper to them, than knowledge, which it is great folly to
say or believe is not always a good thing.</p>

<p class='c001'>43.—“And if I were speaking with them, or with others who
had an opinion contrary to mine, I should strive to show them
how useful and necessary letters are to our life and dignity,
having indeed been granted by God to men as a crowning gift.
Nor should I lack instances of many excellent commanders of
antiquity, who all added the ornament of letters to the valour of
their arms.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus you know Alexander held Homer in such veneration
that he always kept the Iliad by his bedside; and he devoted
the greatest attention not only to these studies but to philosophical
speculation under Aristotle’s guidance. Alcibiades enlarged
his natural aptitudes and made them greater by means
of letters and the teachings of Socrates. The care that Cæsar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>gave to study is also attested by the surviving works that he
divinely wrote. It is said that Scipio Africanus always kept in
his hand the works of Xenophon, wherein the perfect king is
portrayed under the name of Cyrus. I could tell you of Lucullus,
Sulla, Pompey, Brutus,<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c016'><sup>[113]</sup></a> and many other Romans and
Greeks; but I will merely remind you that Hannibal, the illustrious
commander,—although fierce by nature and a stranger to all
humanity, faithless and a despiser of both men and gods,—yet
had knowledge of letters and was conversant with the Greek
language; and if I mistake not, I once read that he even left a
book composed by him in Greek.</p>

<p class='c001'>“However it is superfluous to tell you this, for I well know
that you all see how wrong the French are in thinking that letters
are injurious to arms. You know that glory is the true
stimulus to great and hazardous deeds of war, and whoso is
moved thereto by gain or other motive, besides doing nothing
good, deserves not to be called a gentleman, but a base trafficker.
And true glory is that which is preserved in the sacred
treasure-house of letters, as everyone may understand except
those unfortunates who have never enjoyed them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What soul is there so abject, timid and humble, that when
he reads of the deeds of Cæsar, Alexander, Scipio, Hannibal,
and many others, is not inflamed by an ardent desire to be like
them, and does not make small account of this frail two days’
life, in order to win the almost eternal life of fame, which in
spite of death makes him live in far greater glory than before?
But he who does not feel the delight of letters, cannot either
know how great is the glory they so long preserve, and measures
it by the life of one man or two, because his memory runs
no further. Hence he cannot esteem this short-lived glory so
much as he would that almost eternal glory if knowledge of it
were unhappily not denied him, and as he does not esteem it so
much, we may reasonably believe that he will not run such
danger to pursue it as one who knew it would.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should be far from willing to have an antagonist cite instances
to the contrary in refutation of my view, and urge upon
me that with all their knowledge of letters the Italians have for
some time since shown little martial valour,—which is alas only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>too true.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c016'><sup>[114]</sup></a> But it very certainly might be said that the fault of a
few has brought not only grievous harm but eternal obloquy
upon all the rest; and from them was derived the true cause of
our ruin and of the decadence if not the death of valour in our
souls: yet it would be far more shameful in us to publish it, than
for the French to be ignorant of letters. Therefore it is better
to pass over in silence that which cannot be recalled without
pain: and avoiding this subject (upon which I entered against
my will) to return to our Courtier.</p>

<p class='c001'>44.—“I would have him more than passably accomplished in
letters, at least in those studies that are called the humanities,
and conversant not only with the Latin language but with the
Greek, for the sake of the many different things that have been
admirably written therein.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c016'><sup>[115]</sup></a> Let him be well versed in the
poets, and not less in the orators and historians, and also proficient
in writing verse and prose, especially in this vulgar tongue of
ours;<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c016'><sup>[116]</sup></a> for besides the enjoyment he will find in it, he will by
this means never lack agreeable entertainment with ladies,<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c016'><sup>[117]</sup></a>
who are usually fond of such things. And if other occupations
or want of study prevent his reaching such perfection as to render
his writings worthy of great praise, let him be careful to
suppress them so that others may not laugh at him, and let him
show them only to a friend whom he can trust: because they
will at least be of this service to him, that the exercise will
enable him to judge the work of others. For it very rarely
happens that a man who is not accustomed to write, however
learned he may be, can ever quite appreciate the toil and industry
of writers, or taste the sweetness and excellence of style, and
those latent niceties that are often found in the ancients.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Moreover these studies will also make him fluent, and as
Aristippus said to the tyrant, confident and assured in speaking
with everyone.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c016'><sup>[118]</sup></a> Hence I would have our Courtier keep one
precept fixed in mind; which is that in this and everything else
he should be always on his guard, and diffident rather than forward,
and that he should keep from falsely persuading himself
that he knows that which he does not know. For by nature we
all are fonder of praise than we ought to be, and our ears love
the melody of words that praise us more than any other sweet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>song or sound; and thus, like sirens’ voices, they are often the
cause of shipwreck to him who does not close his ears to such
deceptive harmony. Among the ancient sages this danger was
recognized, and books were written showing in what way the
true friend may be distinguished from the flatterer.<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c016'><sup>[119]</sup></a> But what
does this avail, if there be many, nay a host, of those who clearly
perceive that they are flattered, yet love him who flatters them,
and hold him in hatred who tells them the truth? And often
when they find him who praises them too sparing in his words,
they even help him and say such things of themselves, that the
flatterer is put to shame, most impudent though he be.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let us leave these blind ones to their errour, and have our
Courtier of such good judgment that he will not take black for
white, or have more self-confidence than he clearly knows to be
well founded; and especially in those peculiarities which (if you
remember) messer Cesare in his game said we had often used
as an instrument to bring men’s folly to light. On the contrary,
even if he well knows the praises bestowed upon him to be true,
let him not err by accepting them too openly or confirming them
without some protest; but rather let him as it were disclaim
them modestly, always showing and really esteeming arms as
his chief profession, and all other good accomplishments as an
ornament thereto. And particularly among soldiers let him not
act like those who insist on seeming soldiers in learning, and
learned men among soldiers. In this way, for the reasons we
have alleged, he will avoid affectation, and even the middling
things that he does, shall seem very great.”</p>

<p class='c001'>45.—Messer Pietro Bembo here replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Count, I do not see why you insist that this Courtier, being
lettered and endowed with so many other admirable accomplishments,
should hold everything as an ornament of arms, and not
arms and the rest as an ornament of letters; which without
other accompaniment are as superiour in dignity to arms, as the
mind is to the body, for the practice of them properly pertains
to the mind, as that of arms does to the body.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the Count replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, the practice of arms pertains to both mind and body.
But I would not have you judge in such a cause, messer Pietro, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>you would be too much suspected of bias by one of the two sides:
and as the controversy has already been long waged by very
wise men, there is no need to renew it; but I regard it as settled
in favour of arms, and would have our Courtier so regard it too,
since I may form him as I wish. And if you are of contrary
mind, wait till you hear of a contest wherein he who defends the
cause of arms is allowed to use arms, just as those who defend
letters make use of letters in their defence; for if everyone
avails himself of his proper weapons, you shall see that men of
letters will be worsted.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah,” said messer Pietro, “a while ago you blamed the French
for prizing letters little, and told what glorious lustre is shed on
man by letters and how they make him immortal; and now it
seems you have changed your mind. Do you not remember that</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Before the famous tomb of brave Achilles</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Thus spake the mighty Alexander, sighing:</div>
      <div class='line in2'>‘O happy youth, who found so clear a trumpet,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And lofty bard to make thy deeds undying!’<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c016'><sup>[120]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>And if Alexander envied Achilles not for his deeds, but for the
fortune that had granted him the happiness of having his exploits
celebrated by Homer, we may conclude that Alexander esteemed
Homer’s poems above Achilles’s arms. For what other judge do
you wait then, or for what other sentence upon the dignity of
arms and letters, than that pronounced by one of the greatest
commanders that have ever been?”</p>

<p class='c001'>46.—Then the Count replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I blame the French for thinking that letters are a hindrance
to the profession of arms, and I hold that learning is more proper
to no one than to a warrior; and in our Courtier I would have
these two accomplishments joined and each aided by the other,
as is most proper: nor do I think I have changed my mind in
this. But as I said, I do not wish to discuss which of the two is
more worthy of praise. It is enough that men of letters almost
never select for praise any but great men and glorious deeds,
which in themselves merit praise for the mere essential quality
from which they spring; besides this they are very noble material
for writers: which is a great ornament, and in part the cause of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>perpetuating writings, which perhaps would not be so much read
and appreciated if they lacked their noble theme, but vain and of
little moment.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And if Alexander was envious that Achilles should be
praised by Homer, it does not therefore follow that he esteemed
letters above arms; wherein if he had felt himself as far behind
Achilles as he deemed all those who wrote of him were behind
Homer, I am sure he would far rather have desired fine acts on
his part than fine speeches on the part of others. Hence I
believe that saying of his to have been a tacit eulogy of himself,
and that he was expressing a desire for what he thought he did
not possess (that is, the supreme excellence of a writer), and not
for what he believed he already had attained (that is, prowess in
arms, wherein he did not deem Achilles at all his superior).
Thus he called Achilles happy, as if hinting that although his
own fame had hitherto not been so celebrated in the world as
Achilles’s, which was made bright and illustrious by that poem
so divine,—it was not because his valour and merits were less
or deserving of less praise, but because fortune bestowed upon
Achilles that miracle of nature as a glorious trumpet for his
achievements. Perhaps also he wished to incite some noble
genius to write about him, by showing that this must be as
pleasing to him as were his love and veneration for the sacred
monuments of letters: whereof we have spoken long enough for
the present.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, too long,” replied my lord Ludovico Pio; “for I believe
that in the whole world it would be impossible to find a receptacle
large enough to hold all the things you would have in our
Courtier.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the Count said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Wait a little, for there are many more that he must have.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In that case,” replied Pietro da Napoli, “Grasso de’ Medici
would have a great advantage over messer Pietro Bembo.”<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c016'><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec1.47'></a>47.—Here everyone laughed, and the Count began anew and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My lords, you must know that I am not content with the
Courtier unless he be also a musician and unless, besides understanding
and being able to read notes, he can play upon divers
instruments. For if we consider rightly, there is to be found no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>rest from toil or medicine for the troubled spirit more becoming
and praiseworthy in time of leisure, than this; and especially in
courts, where besides the relief from tedium that music affords
us all, many things are done to please the ladies, whose tender
and gentle spirit is easily penetrated by harmony and filled with
sweetness. Thus it is no marvel that in both ancient and modern
times they have always been inclined to favour musicians,
and have found refreshing spiritual food in music.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I admit that music as well as many other vanities may be
proper to women and perhaps to some that have the semblance
of men, but not to those who really are men; for these ought
not to enervate their mind with delights and thus induce therein
a fear of death.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Say not so,” replied the Count; “for I shall enter upon a
vast sea in praise of music. And I shall call to mind how it
was always celebrated and held sacred among the ancients, and
how very sage philosophers were of opinion that the world is
composed of music, that the heavens make harmony in their
moving, and that the soul, being ordered in like fashion, awakes
and as it were revives its powers through music.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus it is written that Alexander was sometimes excited by
it so passionately, that he was forced almost against his will to
leave the banquet table and rush to arms; and when the musician
changed the temper of the tune, he grew calm again, lay
aside his arms, and returned to the banquet table. Moreover I
will tell you that grave Socrates learned to play the cithern<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c016'><sup>[122]</sup></a> at
a very advanced age. And I remember having once heard that
Plato and Aristotle would have the man of culture a musician
also; and they show by a host of arguments that the power of
music over us is very great, and (for many reasons which would
be too long to tell now) that it must needs be taught from childhood,
not so much for the mere melody that we hear, but for the
power it has to induce in us a fresh and good habit of mind and
an habitual tendency to virtue, which renders the soul more
capable of happiness, just as bodily exercise renders the body
more robust;<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c016'><sup>[123]</sup></a> and that music is not only no hindrance in the
pursuits of peace and war, but is very helpful therein.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“Again, Lycurgus<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c016'><sup>[124]</sup></a> approved of music in his harsh laws. And
we read that in their battles the very warlike Lacedemonians
and Cretans used the cithern and other dulcet instruments; that
many very excellent commanders of antiquity, like Epaminondas,<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c016'><sup>[125]</sup></a>
practised music; and that those who were ignorant of it,
like Themistocles,<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c016'><sup>[126]</sup></a> were far less esteemed. Have you not read
that music was among the first accomplishments which the worthy
old Chiron taught Achilles in tender youth,<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c016'><sup>[127]</sup></a> whom he reared
from the age of nurse and cradle? and that the sage preceptor
insisted that the hands which were to shed so much Trojan blood,
should be often busied with the cithern? Where is the soldier
who would be ashamed to imitate Achilles,—to say nothing of
many other famous commanders whom I could cite?</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore seek not to deprive our Courtier of music, which
not only soothes men’s minds, but often tames wild beasts;<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c016'><sup>[128]</sup></a> and
he who enjoys it not, may be sure that his spirit is ill attuned.
See what power it has, to make (as once it did) a fish submit to
be ridden by a man upon the boisterous sea.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c016'><sup>[129]</sup></a> We find it used
in holy temples to render praise and thanks to God; and we
must believe that it is pleasing to Him and that He has given it
to us as most sweet alleviation for our fatigues and troubles.
Wherefore rough toilers of the field under a burning sun often
cheat their weariness with crude and rustic song. With music
the rude peasant lass, who is up before the day to spin or weave,
wards off her drowsiness and makes her toil a pleasure; music
is very cheering pastime for poor sailors after rain, wind and
tempest: a solace to tired pilgrims on their long and weary
journeys, and often to sorrowing captives in their chains and
fetters. Thus, as stronger proof that melody even if rude is
very great relief from every human toil and care, nature seems
to have taught it to the nurse as chief remedy for the continual
wailing of frail children, who by the sound of her voice are
brought restful and placid sleep, forgetful of the tears so proper
to them and given us in that age by nature as a presage of our
after life.”</p>

<p class='c001'>48.—As the Count now remained silent for a little, the Magnifico
Giuliano said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not at all agree with my lord Gaspar. Nay I think, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>the reasons you give and for many others, that music is not only
an ornament but a necessity to the Courtier. Yet I would have
you declare in what way this and the other accomplishments
that you prescribe for him, are to be practised, and at what time
and in what manner.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c016'><sup>[130]</sup></a> For many things that are praiseworthy
in themselves often become very inappropriate when practised
out of season, and on the other hand, some that seem of little
moment are highly esteemed when made use of opportunely.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec1.49'></a>49.—Then the Count said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Before we enter upon that subject, I wish to discuss another
matter, which I deem of great importance and therefore think
our Courtier ought by no means to omit: and this is to know
how to draw and to have acquaintance with the very art of
painting.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And do not marvel that I desire this art, which to-day may
seem to savour of the artisan and little to befit a gentleman; for
I remember having read that the ancients, especially throughout
Greece, had their boys of gentle birth study painting in school
as an honourable and necessary thing, and it was admitted to
the first rank of liberal arts; while by public edict they forbade
that it be taught to slaves. Among the Romans too, it was held
in highest honour, and the very noble family of the Fabii took
their name from it; for the first Fabius was given the name
<em>Pictor</em>, because,—being indeed a most excellent painter, and so
devoted to painting that when he painted the walls of the temple
of Health,—he inscribed his own name thereon;<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c016'><sup>[131]</sup></a> for although
he was born of a family thus renowned and honoured with so
many consular titles, triumphs and other dignities, and although
he was a man of letters and learned in the law, and numbered
among the orators,—yet he thought to add splendour and ornament
to his fame by leaving a memorial that he had been a
painter. Nor is there lack of many other men of illustrious
family, celebrated in this art; which besides being very noble
and worthy in itself, is of great utility, and especially in war for
drawing places, sites, rivers, bridges, rocks, fortresses, and the
like; since however well we may keep them in memory (which
is very difficult), we cannot show them to others.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And truly he who does not esteem this art, seems to me very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>unreasonable; for this universal fabric that we see,—with the
vast heaven so richly adorned with shining stars, and in the
midst the earth girdled by the seas, varied with mountains,
valleys and rivers, and bedecked with so many divers trees,
beautiful flowers and grasses,—may be said to be a great and
noble picture, composed by the hand of nature and of God; and
whoever is able to imitate it, seems to me deserving of great
praise: nor can it be imitated without knowledge of many things,
as he knows well who tries. Hence the ancients greatly prized
both the art and the artist, which thus attained the summit of
highest excellence; very sure proof of which may be found in
the antique marble and bronze statues that yet are seen.<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c016'><sup>[132]</sup></a> And
although painting is different from sculpture, both the one and
the other spring from the same source, which is good design.
Therefore, as the statues are divine, so we may believe the pictures
were also; the more indeed because they are susceptible
of greater skill.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec1.50'></a>50.—Then my lady Emilia turned to Giancristoforo Romano,
who was sitting with the others there, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“What think you of this opinion? Do you admit that painting
is susceptible of greater skill than sculpture?”<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c016'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Giancristoforo replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I, my Lady, think that sculpture needs more pains, more
skill, and is of greater dignity than painting.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Count rejoined:</p>

<p class='c001'>“In that statues are more enduring, perhaps we might say
they are of greater dignity; for being made as memorials, they
fulfil better than painting the purpose for which they are made.
But besides serving as memorials, both painting and sculpture
serve also to beautify, and in this respect painting is much
superior; for if less diuturnal (so to speak) than sculpture, yet
it is of very long life, and is far more charming so long as it
endures.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Giancristoforo replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I really think that you are speaking against your convictions
and that you are doing so solely for the sake of your
friend Raphael; and perhaps too the excellence you find in his
painting seems to you so consummate that sculpture cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>rival it: but consider that this is praise of an artist and not of his
art.”</p>

<p>MICHELANGELO BUONARROTI<br />1475-1564</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Reduced from a photograph, specially made by Soame, of an anonymous and hitherto
unpublished bronze head at Oxford. From a death-mask, Michelangelo’s pupil Daniele
Ricciarelli da Volterra (1500-1566) prepared a mould, of which this and the similar
“Piot” head in the Louvre are believed to be unchased castings. See C. Drury E.
Fortnum’s article “On the Bronze Portrait Busts of Michelangelo,” etc., in the
Archæological Journal.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Then he continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It seems clear to me that both the one and the other are
artificial imitations of nature; but I do not see how you can say
that truth, such as nature makes it, is not better imitated in a
marble or bronze statue,—wherein the members are round,
formed and measured, as nature makes them,—than in a painting,
where we see nothing but the surface and those colours
that cheat the eyes; nor will you tell me, surely, that being is
not nearer truth than seeming. Moreover I think sculpture is
more difficult, because if a slip is made, it cannot be corrected
(since marble cannot be patched again), but another statue must
be made anew; which does not happen with painting, for one
may change a thousand times, and add and take away, improving
always.”</p>

<p class='c001'>51.—The Count said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am not speaking for Raphael’s sake; nor ought you to
repute me so ignorant as not to know the excellence of Michelangelo
in sculpture, your own, and others’. But I am speaking
of the art, and not of the artists.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You say very truly that both the one and the other are imitations
of nature; but it is not true that painting seems, and
sculpture is. For while statues are round as in life and painting
is seen only on the surface, statues lack many things that paintings
do not lack, and especially light and shade. Thus flesh has
one tone and marble another; and this the painter imitates to
the life by chiaroscuro, greater or less according to the need,—which
the sculptor cannot do. And although the painter does
not make his figure round, he presents the muscles and members
rounded in such fashion as so to join the parts which are
not seen, that we can discern very well that the painter knows
and understands these also. And in this, another and greater
skill is needed to represent those members that are foreshortened
and grow smaller in proportion to the distance by reason
of perspective; which, by means of measured lines, colours,
lights and shades, shows you foreground and distance all on the
single surface of an upright wall, in such proportion as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>chooses.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c016'><sup>[134]</sup></a> Do you really think it of small moment to imitate
the natural colours, in representing flesh or stuffs or any other
coloured thing? The sculptor certainly cannot do this, or
express the grace of black eyes or blue, with the splendour of
their amourous beams. He cannot show the colour of fair hair,
or the gleam of weapons, or a dark night, or a storm at sea, or
its lightnings and thunderbolts, or the burning of a city, or the
birth of rosy dawn with its rays of gold and purple. In short,
he cannot show sky, sea, earth, mountains, woods, meadows,
gardens, rivers, cities, or houses,—all of which the painter
shows.</p>

<p class='c001'>52.—“Therefore painting seems to me nobler and more susceptible
of skill, than sculpture. And I think that it, like other
things, reached the summit of excellence among the ancients:
which still is seen in the few slight remains that are left, especially
in the grottoes of Rome;<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c016'><sup>[135]</sup></a> but much more clearly may it
be perceived in the ancient authors, wherein is such honoured
and frequent mention both of works and of masters, and whereby
we learn how highly they were always honoured by great
lords and by commonwealths.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus we read that Alexander loved Apelles of Ephesus
dearly,—so dearly, that having caused the artist to paint a portrait
of his favourite slave undraped, and hearing that the worthy
painter had become most ardently enamoured of her by
reason of her marvellous beauty, he gave her to Apelles without
hesitation:—munificence truly worthy of Alexander, to sacrifice
not only treasure and states but his very affections and desires;
and sign of exceeding love for Apelles, in order to please the
artist, not to hesitate at displeasing the woman he dearly
loved, who (we may believe) was sorely grieved to change so
great a king for a painter. Many other signs also are told of
Alexander’s favour to Apelles; but he very clearly showed
how highly he esteemed the painter, in commanding by public
edict that none other should presume to paint his portrait.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Here I could tell you of the rivalries of many noble painters,
which filled nearly the whole world with praise and wonderment.
I could tell you with what solemnity ancient emperors
adorned their triumphs with pictures, and set them up in public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>places, and how dearly bought them; and that there were some
painters who gave their works as gifts, esteeming gold and
silver inadequate to pay for them; and how a painting by Protogenes
was prized so highly, that when Demetrius<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c016'><sup>[136]</sup></a> laid siege
to Rhodes and could have gained an entrance by setting fire to
the quarter where he knew the painting was, he refrained from
giving battle so that it might not be burned, and thus did not
capture the place; and that Metrodorus,<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c016'><sup>[137]</sup></a> a philosopher and
very excellent painter, was sent by the Athenians to Lucius
Paulus<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c016'><sup>[138]</sup></a> to teach his children and to adorn the triumph that he
was about to receive. Moreover many noble authors have
written about this art, which is a great sign of the esteem in
which it was held; but I do not wish to enlarge further upon it
in this discussion.</p>

<p class='c001'>“So let it be enough to say that it is fitting for our Courtier
to have knowledge of painting also, as being honourable and
useful and highly prized in those times when men were of far
greater worth than now they are. And if he should never
derive from it other use or pleasure than the help it affords in
judging the merit of statues ancient and modern, of vases, buildings,
medals, cameos, intaglios, and the like,—it also enables him
to appreciate the beauty of living bodies, not only as to delicacy
of face but as to symmetry of all the other parts, both in men
and in every other creature. Thus you see how a knowledge
of painting is a source of very great pleasure. And let those
think of this, who so delight in contemplating a woman’s beauty
that they seem to be in paradise, and yet cannot paint; which if
they could do, they would have much greater pleasure, because
they would more perfectly appreciate that beauty which engenders
such satisfaction in their hearts.”</p>

<p class='c001'>53.—Here messer Cesare Gonzaga laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certainly I am no painter; yet I am sure I have greater
pleasure in looking upon a woman than that admirable Apelles,
whom you just mentioned, would have if he were now come
back to life.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Count replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“This pleasure of yours is not derived wholly from her
beauty, but from the affection that perhaps you bear her; and if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>you will say the truth, the first time you saw that woman you
did not feel a thousandth part of the pleasure that you did afterwards,
although her beauty was the same. Thus you may see
how much more affection had to do with your pleasure, than
beauty had.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not deny this,” said messer Cesare; “but just as my
pleasure is born of affection, so is affection born of beauty.
Thus it may still be said that beauty is the cause of my
pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Count replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Many other causes also inflame our minds, besides beauty:
such as manners, knowledge, speech, gesture, and a thousand
other things which in a way perhaps might also be called beauties;
but above all, the consciousness of being loved. So it is
possible to love very ardently even without that beauty you
speak of; but the love that springs from the outward bodily
beauty which we see, will doubtless give far greater pleasure
to him who appreciates it more than to him who appreciates
it less. Therefore, to return to our subject, I think that Apelles
enjoyed the contemplation of Campaspe’s beauty far more than
Alexander did:<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c016'><sup>[139]</sup></a> for we may easily believe that both men’s love
sprang only from her beauty; and perhaps it was partly on this
account that Alexander resolved to give her to him who seemed
fitted to appreciate her most perfectly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Have you not read that those five maidens of Crotona, whom
the painter Zeuxis chose above the others of that city for the
purpose of forming from them all a single type of surpassing
beauty, were celebrated by many poets as having been adjudged
beautiful by one who must have been a consummate judge of
beauty?”<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c016'><sup>[140]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec1.54'></a>54.—Messer Cesare here seemed ill satisfied and unwilling to
admit for a moment that anyone but himself could taste that
pleasure which he felt in contemplating a woman’s beauty, and
he began to speak. But just then a great tramping of feet was
heard, and the sound of loud talking; whereupon everyone
turned, and a glare of torches was seen at the door of the room,
and soon there arrived, with a numerous and noble company,
my lord Prefect,<a href='#f3' class='c016'><sup>[3]</sup></a> who returned from attending the pope part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>way on the journey. At once on entering the palace he had
asked what my lady Duchess was doing, and had learned of
what manner the game was that evening, and the charge imposed
on Count Ludovico to speak about Courtiership. Therefore
he came as fast as he could, so as to arrive in season to
hear something. Then, immediately after having made his
reverence to my lady Duchess and bidden the others to be
seated (for everyone had risen when he came in),—he too sat
down in the circle with some of his gentlemen; among whom
were the Marquess Febus di Ceva and his brother Gerardino,<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c016'><sup>[141]</sup></a>
messer Ettore Romano,<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c016'><sup>[142]</sup></a> Vincenzo Calmeta,<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c016'><sup>[143]</sup></a> Orazio Florido,<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c016'><sup>[144]</sup></a>
and many others; and as everyone remained silent, my lord
Prefect said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Gentlemen, my coming here would be indeed a pity, if I were
to interrupt such a fine discussion as I think you were just now
engaged in; so do me not this wrong of depriving yourselves
and me of such a pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Count Ludovico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, my Lord, I think we all must be far better pleased to
be silent than to speak; for this burden having fallen more to
me than to the others this evening, I have at last grown weary
of speaking, and I think all the others are weary of listening, for
my talk has not been worthy of this company or adequate to the
lofty theme that I was charged with; in which, having little satisfied
myself, I think I have satisfied the others still less. So you
were fortunate, my Lord, to come in at the end. And for the
rest of the discussion, it would indeed be well to appoint someone
else to take my place, because whoever he may be, I know
he will fill it far better than I should even if I were willing to go
on, being now tired as I am.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico Giuliano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>55.—“I certainly shall not submit to be cheated of the promise
that you made me, and am sure my lord Prefect too will not be
sorry to hear that part of our discussion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what promise was it?” said the Count.</p>

<p class='c001'>“To tell us in what way the Courtier must make use of those
good qualities that you have said befit him,” replied the Magnifico.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although but a boy, my lord Prefect was wise and sensible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>beyond what seemed natural to his tender years, and in his
every movement he showed a loftiness of mind and a certain
vivacity of temper that gave true presage of the high pitch of
manliness that he was to attain. So he said quickly:</p>

<p class='c001'>“If all this is to be told, I think I have come just in time; for
by hearing in what way the Courtier must use his good qualities,
I shall hear also what they are, and thus shall come to learn
everything that has been said before. So do not refuse, Count,
to fulfil the obligation of which you have already performed a
part.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should not have so heavy an obligation to fulfil,” replied
the Count, “if the labour were more evenly divided; but the
mistake was made of giving the right of command to a too partial
lady;” and then laughing he turned to my lady Emilia, who
quickly said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is not you who ought to complain of my partiality; but
since you do so without reason, we will give someone else a
share of this honour, which you call labour;” and turning to
messer Federico Fregoso, she said: “You proposed the game of
the Courtier, hence it is right that you should bear some share
in it; and this shall be to comply with my lord Magnifico’s request,
by declaring in what way, manner and time, the Courtier
ought to make use of his good qualities and practise those things
which the Count has said it is fitting he should know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Federico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lady, in trying to separate the way and the time and the
manner of the Courtier’s good qualities and good practice, you
try to separate that which cannot be separated, because these
are the very things that make his qualities good, and his practice
good. Therefore, since the Count has spoken so much and so
well, and has touched somewhat upon these matters and arranged
in his mind the rest of what he has to say, it was only right that
he should continue to the end.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Account yourself to be the Count,” said my lady Emilia,
“and say what you think he would say; and thus all will be
right.”</p>

<p class='c001'>56.—Then Calmeta said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lords, since the hour is late, and in order that messer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Federico may have no excuse for not telling what he knows, I
think it would be well to postpone the rest of the discussion until
to-morrow, and let the little time we have left, be spent in some
other quiet diversion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As everyone approved, my lady Duchess desired madonna
Margarita<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c016'><sup>[145]</sup></a> and madonna Costanza Fregosa<a href='#f57' class='c016'><sup>[57]</sup></a> to dance. Whereupon
Barletta,<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c016'><sup>[146]</sup></a> a very charming musician and excellent dancer,
who always kept the whole court in good humour, began to play
upon his instruments; and joining hands, the two ladies danced
first a basset and then a <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>roegarze</i></span>,<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c016'><sup>[147]</sup></a> with consummate grace and
to the great delight of those who saw them. Then the night
being already far spent, my lady Duchess rose to her feet, and
so everyone reverently took leave and retired to sleep.</p>

</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c005'>
    <div>TO MESSER ALFONSO ARIOSTO</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec2.1'></a>1.—I have often considered not without wonder whence arises
a fault, which, as it is universally found among old people, may
be believed to be proper and natural to them. And this is, that
they nearly all praise bygone times and censure the present,
inveighing against our acts and ways and everything which
they in their youth did not do; affirming too that every good
custom and good manner of living, every virtue, in short every
thing, is always going from bad to worse.</p>

<p class='c001'>And verily it seems quite contrary to reason and worthy to be
wondered at, that ripe age, which in other matters is wont to
make men’s judgment more perfect with long experience, should
in this matter so corrupt it that they do not perceive that if the
world were always growing worse, and if fathers were generally
better than children, we should long since have reached
that last grade of badness beyond which it is impossible to grow
worse. And yet we see that not only in our days but in bygone
times this failing has always been peculiar to old age, which is
clearly gathered from the works of many ancient authors, and
especially of the comic writers, who better than the others set
forth the image of human life.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now the cause of this wrong judgment among old people I
for my part take to be, that the fleeting years despoil them of
many good things, and among others in great part rob the
blood of vital spirits; whence the complexion changes, and
those organs become weak through which the soul exerts its
powers.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c016'><sup>[148]</sup></a> Thus in old age the sweet flowers of contentment fall
from our hearts, like leaves from a tree in autumn, and in place
of serene and sunny thoughts, comes cloudy and turbid sadness
with its train of thousand ills. So that not the body only but
the mind also is infirm; of bygone pleasures naught is left but a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>lingering memory and the image of that precious time of tender
youth, in which (when it is with us) sky and earth and all things
seem to us ever making merry and laughing before our eyes,
and the sweet springtide of happiness seems to blossom in our
thought, as in a delightful and lovely garden.</p>

<p class='c001'>Therefore in the evening chill of life, when our sun begins to
sink to its setting and steals away those pleasures, we should
fare better if in losing them, we could lose the memory of them
also, and as Themistocles said, find an art that shall teach us to
forget. For so deceitful are our bodily senses, that they often
cheat even the judgment of our minds. Thus it seems to me
that old people are in like case with those who keep their eyes
fixed upon the land as they leave port, and think their ship
is standing still and the shore recedes, although it is the other
way. For both the port and also time and its pleasures remain
the same, and one after another we take flight in the ship of
mortality upon that boisterous sea which absorbs and devours
everything, and are never suffered to touch shore again, but
always tossed by adverse winds we are wrecked upon some
rock at last.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since therefore the senile mind is an unfit subject for many
pleasures, it cannot enjoy them; and just as to men in fever,
when the palate is spoiled by corrupt vapours, all wines seem
bitter, however precious and delicate they be,—so old men,
because of their infirmity (which yet does not deprive them of
appetite), find pleasures flat and cold and very different from
those which they remember tasting of old, although the pleasures
are intrinsically the same. Thus they feel themselves despoiled,
and they lament and call the present times bad, not
perceiving that the change lies in themselves and not in the
times; and on the other hand they call to mind their bygone
pleasures, and bring back the time when these were enjoyed
and praise it as good, because it seems to carry with it a savour
of what they felt when it was present. For in truth our minds
hold all things hateful that have been with us in our sorrows,
and love those that have been with us in our joys.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>This is why it is sometimes highest bliss for a lover to look at
a window although closed, because he there had once the happiness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>to gaze upon the lady of his love; and in the same way to
look at a ring, a letter, a garden or other place, or what you
will, which seems to him a conscious witness of his joys. And
on the contrary, a gorgeous and beautiful room will often be
irksome to a man who has been prisoner or has suffered some
other sorrow there. And I once knew some who would not
drink from a cup like that from which in illness they had taken
medicine. For just as to the one the window or ring or letter
recalls the sweet memory that gives him such delight and seems
part of his bygone joy,—so to the other, the room or cup brings
his illness or imprisonment to mind. I believe that the same
cause leads old people to praise bygone times and to censure
the present.</p>

<p class='c001'>2.—Therefore as they speak of other things, so do they also of
courts, affirming those which they remember, to have been far
more excellent and full of eminent men than those which we see
to-day. And as soon as such discussions are started, they begin
to extol with boundless praise the courtiers of Duke Filippo or
Duke Borso;<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c016'><sup>[149]</sup></a> and they narrate the sayings of Niccolò Piccinino;<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c016'><sup>[150]</sup></a>
and they remind us that there were no murders in those
days (or very few at most), no brawls, no ambushes, no deceits,
but a certain frank and kindly good will among all men, a loyal
confidence; and that in the courts of that time such good behaviour
and decorum prevailed, that courtiers were all like monks,
and woe to him who should have spoken insultingly to another,
or so much as made a less than decorous gesture to a woman.
And on the other hand they say everything is the reverse in these
days, and that not only have courtiers lost their fraternal love
and gentle mode of life, but that nothing prevails in courts but
envy, malice, immorality and very dissolute living, with every
sort of vice,—the women lascivious without shame, the men
effeminate. They condemn our dress also as indecorous and too
womanish.</p>

<p class='c001'>In short they censure an infinity of things, among which many
indeed merit censure, for it cannot be denied that there are many
bad and wicked men among us, or that this age of ours is much
fuller of vice than that which they praise.<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c016'><sup>[151]</sup></a> Yet it seems to me
that they ill discern the cause of this difference, and that they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>foolish. For they would have the world contain all good and no
evil, which is impossible; because, since evil is opposed to good
and good to evil, it is almost necessary, by force of opposition
and counterpoise as it were, that the one should sustain and
fortify the other, and that if either wanes or waxes, so must the
other also, since there is no contrary without its contrary.</p>

<p class='c001'>Who does not know that there would be no justice in the
world, if there were no wrongs? No courage, if there were no
cowards? No continence, if there were no incontinence? No
health, if there were no infirmity? No truth, if there were no
lying? No good fortune, if there were no misfortunes? Thus,
according to Plato,<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c016'><sup>[152]</sup></a> Socrates well says it is surprising that Æsop
did not write a fable showing that as God had never been able
to join pleasure and pain together, He joined them by their extremities,
so that the beginning of the one should be the end of
the other; for we see that no joy can give us pleasure, unless
sorrow precedes it. Who can hold rest dear, unless he has first
felt the hardship of fatigue? Who enjoys food, drink and sleep,
unless he has first endured hunger, thirst and wakefulness?
Hence I believe that sufferings and diseases were given man by
nature not chiefly to make him subject to them (since it does not
seem fitting that she who is mother of every good should give us
such evils of her own determined purpose), but as nature created
health, joy and other blessings,—diseases, sorrows and other ills
followed after them as a consequence. In like manner, the virtues
having been bestowed upon the world by grace and gift of nature,
at once by force of that same bounden opposition, the vices became
their fellows by necessity; so that always as the one waxes or
wanes, thus likewise must needs the other wax or wane.</p>

<p class='c001'>3.—So when our old men praise bygone courts for not containing
such vicious men as some that our courts contain, they do not
perceive that their courts did not contain such virtuous men as
some that ours contain; which is no marvel, for no evil is so bad
as that which springs from the corrupted seed of good, and hence,
as nature now puts forth far better wits than she did then, those
who devote themselves to good, do far better than was formerly
done, and likewise those who devote themselves to evil, do far
worse. Therefore we must not on that account say that those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>who refrained from evil because they did not know how to do
evil, deserved any praise for it; for although they did little harm,
they did the worst they could. And that the wits of those times
were generally inferior to those of our time, can be well enough
perceived in all that we see of those times, both in letters and in
pictures, statues, buildings, and every other thing.</p>

<p class='c001'>These old men censure us also for many a thing that in itself
is neither good nor evil, simply because they did not do
it. And they say it is not seemly for young men to ride through
the city on horse, still less in pumps, to wear fur linings or
long skirts in winter, or to wear a cap before reaching at least
the age of eighteen years, and the like; wherein they certainly
are wrong, for besides being convenient and useful, these customs
have been introduced by usage and meet universal favour,
just as formerly it was to go about in gala dress with open
breeches and polished pumps, and for greater elegance to carry
a sparrow-hawk on the wrist all day without reason, to dance
without touching the lady’s hand, and to follow many other
fashions that now would be as very clumsy as they then were
highly prized.</p>

<p class='c001'>Therefore let it be allowed us also to follow the custom of our
time without being slandered by these old men, who in their
wish to praise themselves, often say: “When I was twenty
years old, I still slept with my mother and sisters, nor did I for
a long time afterwards know what women are; while now, boys
hardly have hair on their heads before they know more tricks
than grown men did in our time.” Nor do they perceive that in
saying this they acknowledge that our boys have more mind
than their old men had.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let them cease then to censure our time as full of vices, for in
removing the vices they would remove the virtues too; and let
them remember that among the worthies of old, in the ages
when there lived those spirits who were glorious and truly divine
in every virtue, and those more than human minds,—there were
also to be found many very bad men; who (if they were living)
would be as eminently bad among our bad men, as the good
men of that time would be eminently good. And of this, all
history gives ample proof.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>4.—But I think these old men have now sufficient answer. So
we will end this homily, perhaps already too diffuse but not
wholly irrelevant to our subject; and as it is enough for us to
have shown that the courts of our time were worthy of no less
praise than those which old men praise so highly,—we will pursue
the discussion about the Courtier, from which we may easily
understand what rank the court of Urbino held among other
courts, and of what quality were the Prince and Lady to whom
such noble spirits did service, and how fortunate they might hold
themselves who lived in such companionship.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec2.5'></a>5.—Now the following day having arrived, there were many and
diverse discussions among the cavaliers and ladies of the court
concerning the debate of the evening before; which in great part
arose because my lord Prefect, eager to know what had been
said, questioned nearly everyone about it, and (as is always wont
to be the case) he received different answers; for some praised
one thing and some another, and among many too there was
disagreement as to the Count’s real opinion, since everyone’s
memory did not quite fully retain the things that were said.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus the matter was discussed nearly all day; and as soon as
night set in, my lord Prefect desired that food be served and took
all the gentlemen away to supper. When they had done eating,
he repaired to the room of my lady Duchess, who, on seeing such
a numerous company and earlier than the custom was, said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Methinks, messer Federico, it is a heavy burden that is
placed upon your shoulders, and great the expectation you must
satisfy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then without waiting for messer Federico to reply, the Unico
Aretino said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what, forsooth, is this great burden? Who is so foolish
that when he knows how to do a thing, does not do it in proper
season?”</p>

<p class='c001'>So, discoursing of this, everyone sat down in the usual place
and order, with eager expectation for the debate appointed.</p>

<p class='c001'>6.—Then messer Federico turned to the Unico, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“So, my lord Unico, you do not think that a laborious part
and a great burden are imposed on me this evening, having to
show in what way, manner and time the Courtier ought to employ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>his good accomplishments and practise those things that
have been said to befit him?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It seems to me no great matter,” replied the Unico; “and I
think it is quite enough to say that the Courtier should have good
judgment, as the Count last evening rightly said he must; and
this being so, I think that without other precepts he ought to be
able to use what he knows seasonably and in a well bred way.
To try to reduce this to more exact rules would be too difficult
and perhaps superfluous. For I know no man so stupid as to
wish to fence when others are intent on dancing; or to go through
the street dancing a morris-dance, however admirably he might
know how; or in trying to comfort a mother whose child has
died, to begin with pleasantries and witticism. Surely methinks
no gentleman would do this, who was not altogether
a fool.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Federico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It seems to me, my lord Unico, that you run too much to
extremes. For one may sometimes be silly in a way that is
not so easily seen, and faults are not always of the same degree:
and it may be that a man will refrain from public and too patent
folly,—such as that would be of which you tell, to dance a morris-dance
about the piazza,—and yet cannot refrain from praising
himself out of season, from displaying a tiresome conceit, from
occasionally saying something to cause laughter, which falls
cold and wholly flat from being said inopportunely. And these
faults are often covered by a kind of veil that does not suffer
them to be seen by him who commits them, unless he searches
for them with care; and although our eyes see little for many
reasons, they most of all are clouded by conceit, since everyone
likes to make a show in that wherein he believes himself proficient,
whether his belief be true or false.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore it seems to me that the right course in this regard
lies in a certain prudent and judicious choice, and in discerning
the more or less which all things gain or lose by being done
opportunely or out of season. And although the Courtier may
possess good enough judgment to perceive these distinctions,
yet I think it would surely be easier for him to attain what he is
seeking, if we were to broaden his mind by a few precepts, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>show him the way and as it were the foundations upon which
he must build,—than if he were to follow generalities only.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec2.7'></a>7.—“Last evening the Count spoke about Courtiership so fully
and so beautifully, that he has aroused in me no little fear and
doubt whether I shall be able to satisfy this noble company so
well in what I have to say, as he did in what it fell to him
to say. Yet to make myself a sharer in his fame as far as I can,
and to be sure of avoiding this one mistake at least, I shall contradict
him in nothing.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Accepting his opinions then, and among others his opinion
as to the Courtier’s noble birth, capacities, bodily form and
grace of feature,—I say that to win praise justly and good
opinion from everyone and favour from the princes whom he
serves, I deem it necessary for the Courtier to know how to dispose
his whole life, and to make the most of his good qualities
in intercourse with all men everywhere, without exciting envy
thereby. And how difficult this in itself is, we may infer from
the fewness of those who are seen to reach the goal; for by
nature we all are more ready to censure mistakes than to praise
things well done, and many men, from a kind of innate malignity
and although they clearly see the good, seem to strive with
every effort and pains to find either some hidden fault in us or
at least some semblance of fault.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus it is needful for our Courtier to be cautious in his every
action, and always to mingle good sense with what he says or
does. And let him not only take care that his separate parts
and qualities are excellent, but let him order the tenour of his
life in such fashion, that the whole may be in keeping with
these parts and be seen to be always and in everything accordant
with his own self and form one single body of all these
good qualities; so that his every act may be the result and
compound of all his faculties, as the Stoics say is the duty of
him who is wise.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Still, although in every action one faculty is always chief,
yet all are so enlinked together, that they make for one end and
may all further and serve every purpose. Hence he must know
how to make the most of them, and by means of contrast and as
it were foil to the one, he must make the other more clearly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>seen;—like good painters, who display and show forth the lights
of projecting objects by the use of shadow, and likewise deepen
the shadows of flat objects by means of light, and so assemble
their divers colours that both the one and the other are better
displayed by reason of that diversity, and the placing of figures
in opposition one to another aids them to perform that office
which is the painter’s aim.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus gentleness is very admirable in a man of noble birth
who is valiant and strong. And as his boldness seems greater
when accompanied by modesty, so his modesty is enhanced and
set off by his boldness.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c016'><sup>[153]</sup></a> Hence to speak little, to do much, and
not to boast of praiseworthy deeds but to conceal them tactfully,—enhances
both these attributes in the case of one who
knows how to employ this method with discretion; and so it is
with all other good qualities.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore in what our Courtier does or says I would have
him follow a few universal rules, which I think comprise briefly
all that I have to say. And for the first and most important let
him above all avoid affectation, as the Count rightly advised last
evening. Next let him consider well what thing it is that he is
doing or saying, the place where he is doing it, in whose presence,
the cause that impels him, his age, his profession, the
object he has in view, and the means that may conduce thereto;
and so, with these precautions let him apply himself discreetly
to whatever he has a mind to do or say.”</p>

<p class='c001'>8.—After messer Federico had spoken thus, he seemed to pause
a little. Whereupon my lord Morello da Ortona at once said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“These rules of yours teach little, it seems to me; and for my
part I know as much about it now, as I did before you propounded
them. Still I remember having heard them several
times before also from the friars to whom I made confession, and
who called them ‘the circumstances,’ I think.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Federico laughed and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“If you remember rightly, the Count declared last evening
that the Courtier’s chief business should be that of arms, and
spoke at length about the way in which he ought to practise it;
therefore we will not repeat this. Yet among our rules we may
also lay it down that when our Courtier finds himself in a skirmish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>or action or battle, or in other such affairs, he ought to arrange
discreetly to withdraw from the crowd, and to perform
those glorious and brave deeds that he has to do, with as little
company as he can, and in sight of all the noblest and most
respected men in the army, and especially in the presence and
(if it is possible) before the very eyes of his king or of the prince
whom he serves; for in truth it is very proper to make the most
of one’s good deeds. And I think that just as it is wrong to seek
false and unmerited renown, so it is wrong also to defraud oneself
of the honour that is one’s due, and not to seek that praise
which alone is the true reward of worthy effort.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And I remember having in my time known some men who
were very stupid in this regard, although valiant, and who put
their lives as much in danger to capture a flock of sheep, as
to be the first to scale the walls of a beleaguered town; which
our Courtier will not do if he bears in mind the motive that
leads him into war, which should be honour only. And again
if he happens to be playing at arms in public shows,—such as
jousts, tourneys, stick-throwing, or any other bodily exercise,—mindful
of the place and presence in which he is, he will contrive
to be not less elegant and graceful than unerring with his
weapons, and to feast the spectators’ eyes with all those things
which he thinks may give him an added grace. He will take
care that his horse is bravely caparisoned, that his attire becomes
him, that his mottoes are appropriate and his devices
clever, so that they may attract the eyes of the bystanders as
the loadstone attracts iron. He will never be among the last
to show themselves, knowing that the crowd and especially
women gaze much more attentively upon the first than upon
the last; for their eyes and minds, which at the start are eager
for novelty and observe and are impressed by every trifle, are
afterwards not only sated by repetition but even grow weary.
Thus there was an excellent actor of ancient times, who for
this reason always wished to be the first to perform his part
in the play.</p>

<p class='c001'>“So too, even in speaking of arms, our Courtier will have
regard to the profession of those with whom he converses, and
will govern himself accordingly,—speaking in one way with men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>and in another way with women. And if he wishes to touch
on something that is to his credit, he will do so covertly, as if
by chance in passing, and with the discreetness and caution that
Count Ludovico expounded to us yesterday.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec2.9'></a>9.—“Does it not seem to you now, my lord Morello, that our
rules may teach something? Does it not seem to you that our
friend, of whom I was telling you a few days since, quite forgot
with whom and why he was speaking, when to entertain a lady
he had never seen before, he began his talk by telling her that
he had slain so many men, and that he was a terrible fellow
and knew how to handle a sword with both hands? Nor did
he leave her until he had tried to explain to her how certain
blows of the battle-axe ought to be parried when one is armed
and how when unarmed, and to show the different ways of
grasping the handle; so that the poor soul was on the rack, and
thought the hour seemed a thousand years before she could send
him off, almost fearing that he would slay her like the others. Such
are the mistakes committed by those who pay no regard to the
‘circumstances,’ of which you say you heard from the friars.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Next I say that of bodily exercises there are some that
are almost never practised except in public,—such as jousts,
tourneys, stick-throwing, and all the rest that have to do with
arms. Hence when our Courtier has to take part in these,
he must first contrive to be so well equipped in point of horses,
weapons and dress, that he lacks nothing. And if he does not
feel himself well provided with everything, let him on no account
engage, for if he fails to do well, the excuse cannot be made that
these things are not his business. Then he must carefully consider
in whose presence he is seen and of what sort the company
is, for it would not be seemly for a gentleman to honour a rustic
festival with his presence, where the spectators and the company
are of low degree.”</p>

<p class='c001'>10.—Then my lord Gaspar Pallavicino said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“In our Lombard country we do not make these distinctions.
On the contrary, there are many young gentlemen who dance
all day with peasants in the sun on holidays, and play with them
at throwing the bar, wrestling, running and leaping. And I do
not think it amiss, for there the rivalry is not of birth, but of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>strength and agility, wherein villagers are often quite a match
for nobles; and this condescension seems to have in it a pleasant
touch of generosity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Federico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“This dancing of yours in the sun pleases me not in any way,
nor do I see what gain there is in it. But in my opinion whoever
cares to wrestle or run or leap with peasants, ought to do
so as a matter of practice and out of courtesy as we say, not in
rivalry with them. And a man ought to be almost sure of winning;
else let him not engage, because it is too unseemly and
shameful a thing, and beneath his dignity, to see a gentleman
vanquished by a peasant, and especially at wrestling. Hence I
think it is well to abstain, at least in the presence of many, for
the gain of beating is very small and the loss of being beaten is
very great.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The game of tennis also is nearly always played in public,
and is one of those sports to which a crowd lends much distinction.
Therefore I would have our Courtier practise this, and all
the others except the handling of arms, as something that is not
his profession, and let him show that he does not seek or expect
praise for it, nor let him seem to devote much care or time to it,
although he may do it admirably. Nor let him be like some
men who delight in music, and in speaking with anyone always
begin to sing under their breath whenever there is a pause in the
conversation. Others always go dancing as they pass through
streets and churches. Others, when they meet a friend in the
piazza or anywhere else, at once put themselves in posture as if
for fencing or wrestling, according to their favourite humour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here messer Cesare Gonzaga said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“A young cardinal we have in Rome does better than that; for
out of pride in his fine bodily frame, he conducts into his garden
all who come to visit him (even although he has never seen
them before), and urgently presses them to strip to the doublet
and try a turn with him at leaping.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec2.11'></a>11.—Messer Federico laughed; then he went on:</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are certain other exercises that can be practised in
public and in private, like dancing; and in this I think the
Courtier ought to have a care, for when dancing in the presence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>of many and in a place full of people, it seems to me that he
should preserve a certain dignity, albeit tempered with a lithe
and airy grace of movement; and although he may feel himself
to be very nimble and a master of time and measure, let him not
attempt those agilities of foot and double steps which we find
very becoming in our friend Barletta, but which perhaps would
be little suited to a gentleman. Yet in a room privately, as we
are now, I think he may try both, and may dance morris-dances
and brawls;<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c016'><sup>[154]</sup></a> but not in public unless he be masked, when it is
not displeasing even though he be recognized by all.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed there is no better way of displaying oneself in such
matters at public sports, either armed or unarmed; because disguise
carries with it a certain freedom and licence, which
among other things enable a man to choose a part for which he
feels himself qualified, and to use care and elaboration upon the
chief point of the thing wherein he would display himself, and a
certain nonchalance as to that which does not count,—which
greatly enhances the charm: as for a youth to array himself
like an old man, yet in easy dress so as to be able to show his
vigour; a cavalier in the guise of a rustic shepherd or some
other like costume, but with a perfect horse and gracefully bedecked
in character;—because the mind of the spectators is
quick to fill out the image of that which is presented to the eyes
at first glance; and then seeing the thing turn out much better
than the costume promised, they are amused and delighted.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But in these sports and shows where masks are worn, it would
not be seemly for a prince to try to enact the part of a prince, because
that pleasure which the spectators find in novelty would be
in great measure lacking, since it is news to no one that the prince
is the prince; and he, conscious that besides being the prince he
is trying to play the prince, loses the freedom to do all those
things that are beneath a prince’s dignity. And if there were
any contest in these sports, especially with arms, he might even
make men think that he chose to impersonate a prince in order
not to be beaten but spared by others; moreover were he to do
in sport the same that it behooves him to do in earnest upon occasion,
he would deprive his own proper action of dignity, and
make it almost seem as if that too were sport. But at such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>times, if the prince lays aside his character of prince, and mingles
equally with his inferiors yet in such fashion as to be recognizable,
by renouncing his own rank he attains a higher one, in that
he prefers to excel the rest not by authority but by merit, and to
show that his worth is not enhanced by the fact that he is a
prince.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec2.12'></a>12.—“I say then that in these martial sports the Courtier ought
to use the like discretion, according to his rank. In horseback
vaulting too, in wrestling, running and leaping, I should be well
pleased to have him shun the vulgar crowd, or at most let himself
be very rarely seen; for there is not on earth a thing so excellent
but the ignorant will tire of it and hold it of small account,
if they see it often.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As to music I hold the same opinion: hence I would not
have our Courtier behave like many, who are no sooner come
anywhere (even into the presence of gentlemen with whom they
have no acquaintance), than without waiting to be urged they
set about doing what they know and often what they do not
know; so that it seems as if they had come only for the purpose
of showing themselves, and had that for their chief profession.
Therefore let the Courtier resort to music as a pastime and almost
unwillingly, and not before vulgar people nor very many. And
although he may know and understand that which he is doing,
in this too I would have him hide the study and pains that are
necessary in everything one would do well, and seem to value
this accomplishment lightly in himself, but by practising it
admirably make others value it highly.”</p>

<p class='c001'>13.—Then my lord Gaspar Pallavicino said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are many kinds of music, vocal as well as instrumental:
therefore I should like to hear which is the best of all, and
at what time the Courtier ought to perform it.”<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c016'><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Federico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I regard as beautiful music, to sing well by note, with ease
and in beautiful style; but as even far more beautiful, to sing to
the accompaniment of the viol,<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c016'><sup>[156]</sup></a> because nearly all the sweetness
lies in the solo part, and we note and observe the fine
manner and the melody with much greater attention when our
ears are not occupied with more than a single voice, and moreover
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>every little fault is more clearly discerned,—which is not
the case when several sing together, because each singer helps
his neighbour. But above all, singing to the viol by way of
recitative seems to me most delightful, which adds to the words
a charm and grace that are very admirable.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>“All keyed instruments also are pleasing to the ear, because
they produce very perfect consonances, and upon them one can
play many things that fill the mind with musical delight. And
not less charming is the music of the stringed quartet, which is
most sweet and exquisite. The human voice lends much ornament
and grace to all these instruments, with which I would
have our Courtier at least to some degree acquainted, albeit the
more he excels with them, the better,—without troubling himself
much with those that Minerva forbade to Alcibiades, because it
seems that they are ungraceful.<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c016'><sup>[157]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Then, as to the time for enjoying these various kinds of
music, I think it is whenever a man finds himself in familiar and
beloved companionship and there are not other occupations.
But above all it is fitting where ladies are present, because their
aspect fills the listener’s heart with sweetness, renders it more
sensitive to the tenderness of the music, and quickens the musician’s
soul.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As I have already said, it pleases me well that we should
avoid the crowd, and especially the ignoble crowd. But discretion
must needs be the spice of everything, for it would be quite
impossible to foresee all the cases that occur; and if the Courtier
rightly understands himself, he will adapt himself to the
occasion and will perceive when the minds of his hearers are
disposed to listen and when not. He will take his own age into
account: for it is indeed unseemly and unlovely in the extreme
to see a man of any quality,—old, hoary and toothless, full of
wrinkles,—playing on a viol and singing in the midst of a company
of ladies, even though he be a passable performer. And
the reason of this is that in singing the words are usually amourous,
and love is a ridiculous thing in old men,—albeit it is sometimes
pleased among its other miracles to kindle frozen hearts
in spite of years.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec2.14'></a>14.—Then the Magnifico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“Do not deprive old men of this pleasure, messer Federico;
for in my time I have known old men who had right perfect
voices and hands very dexterous upon their instruments, far
more than some young men.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not wish,” said messer Federico, “to deprive old men of
this pleasure, but I do wish to deprive you and these ladies of
the pleasure of laughing at such folly. And if old men wish to
sing to the viol, let them do so in secret and only to drive from
their minds those painful thoughts and grievous troubles with
which our life is filled, and to taste that rapture which I believe
Pythagoras and Socrates found in music.<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c016'><sup>[158]</sup></a> And even although
they practise it not, by somewhat accustoming their minds to it
they will enjoy it far more when they hear it than a man who
knows nothing of it. For just as the arms of a smith, who is
weak in his other members, become stronger by exercise than
those of another man who is more robust but unaccustomed to
use his arms,—in like manner ears practised in harmony will
perceive it better and more speedily and will appreciate it with
far greater pleasure, than others, however good and sharp they
be, that are not versed in the varieties of musical consonance;
because these modulations do not penetrate ears unused to
hearing them, but pass aside without leaving any savour of
themselves; albeit even the beasts have some enjoyment in
melody.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This then is the pleasure it is fitting old men should take in
music. I say the like of dancing, for in truth we ought to give
up these exercises before our age forces us to give them up
against our will.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here my lord Morello replied with a little heat:</p>

<p class='c001'>“So it is better to exclude all old men, and to say that only
young men have a right to be called Courtiers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Federico laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You see, my lord Morello, that they who like these things
strive to seem young when they are not, and hence they dye
their hair and shave twice a week.<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c016'><sup>[159]</sup></a> And this is because nature
silently tells them that such things are proper only to the
young.”</p>

<p class='c001'>All the ladies laughed, for each one of them felt that these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>words fitted my lord Morello; and he seemed rather stung by
them. Messer Federico soon continued:</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec2.15'></a>15.—“But there are many other ways of entertaining ladies
that are proper to old men.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What are they?” said my lord Morello. “Telling stories?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That is one,” replied messer Federico. “But as you know,
every age brings its own thoughts with it, and has some peculiar
virtue and some peculiar vice. Thus, while old men are ordinarily
more prudent than young men, more continent and wiser,
so too they are more garrulous, miserly, querulous and timid;
they are always scolding about the house, harsh to their children,
and wish everyone to follow their way. And on the contrary
young men are spirited, generous, frank, but prone to
quarrel, voluble, loving and hating in an instant, eager in all
their pleasures, unfriendly to him who counsels well.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But of all ages, that of manhood is the most temperate,
because it has left the faults of youth behind and has not yet
reached those of old age. Being placed then at the two extremes,
young and old must needs learn from reason how to correct
the faults that nature implants in them. Thus, old men
ought to guard against much self-praise and the other evil
habits that we have said are peculiar to them, and to use that
prudence and knowledge which they have gained from long
experience, and to be like oracles consulted of all men; and in
telling what they know, they ought to have the grace to speak
to the point and temper the gravity of their years with a certain
mild and sportive humour. In this way they will be good Courtiers,
enjoy their intercourse with men and with ladies, and be
always welcome,—without singing or dancing; and when need
arises they will display their worth in affairs of importance.</p>

<p class='c001'>16.—“Let young men use this same care and judgment, not indeed
in copying old men’s ways,—for that which befits the one
would not at all befit the other, and we are wont to say that
over wisdom is a bad sign in the young,—but in correcting their
own natural faults. Hence I greatly like to see a youth, and
especially when handling weapons, who has a touch of the
grave and taciturn; who is master of himself, without those restless
manners which are often seen at that age; because such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>youths seem to have a certain something in them above the rest.
Moreover this quietness of manner has in it a kind of impressive
boldness, because it seems the result not of anger but of judgment,
and governed more by reason than by passion. This
is nearly always found in all men of high courage, and we see it
also among those brute animals that have more nobility and
strength than their fellows,—as in the lion and the eagle.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nor is this strange; for an impetuous and sudden movement,—which
without words or other signs of wrath abruptly bursts
with all its force at once from the quiet that is its contrary, as it
were like the discharge of a cannon,—is far more violent and
furious than that which increases by degrees and grows hotter
little by little. Therefore they who talk much and move about
and cannot stand still, when they have an enterprise on foot,
seem thus to exhaust their powers; and as our friend messer Pietro
Monte well says, they act like boys who sing from fear when they
walk at night, as if to keep up their courage by their singing.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Again, just as calm and thoughtful youthfulness is very
praiseworthy in a young man, because the levity which is the
fault peculiar to his age seems to be tempered and corrected,—so
in an old man a green and lively old age is to be highly
esteemed, because his stoutness of heart seems to be so great as
to warm and strengthen his feeble and chill years, and to keep
him in that middle state which is the best part of our life.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec2.17'></a>17.—“But in brief not even all these qualities in our Courtier
will suffice to win universal favour of lords, cavaliers and ladies,
unless he has also a gentle and amiable manner in daily talk.
And I verily believe it to be difficult to give any rule for this,
because of the infinite variety of things that arise in conversation,
and because among all the men on earth no two are found
who have minds quite alike. So whoever has to prepare himself
for conversation with many, must needs be guided by his
own judgment, and distinguishing the differences between one
man and another, must daily change his style and method
according to the character of the person with whom he has to
converse. Nor could I for my part give other rules in this
matter than those already given, which our friend my lord
Morello has learned at the confessional from his youth up.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Here my lady Emilia laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You shirk labour too much, messer Federico. But you
shall not succeed, for you must talk on until it is time to go to
bed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what, my Lady, if I have nothing to say?” replied
messer Federico.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There you shall show your wit,” said my lady Emilia. “And
if what I once heard be true, that there was a man so clever and
eloquent that he did not lack material to write a book in praise
of a fly, others in praise of the fourth day ague, and another in
praise of baldness,—will you also not have the courage to find
something to say about Courtiership for one evening?”<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c016'><sup>[160]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“We have already said enough about it to make two books,”
replied messer Federico. “But since my excuse is of no avail, I
will talk until you think I have fulfilled, if not my duty, at least
the limit of my powers.</p>

<p class='c001'>18.—“I think that the conversation which the Courtier ought
most to try in every way to make acceptable, is that which he
holds with his prince; and although this word ‘conversation’
implies a certain equality that seems impossible between a lord
and his inferior, yet we will call it so for the present. Therefore,
besides daily showing everyone that he possesses the worth we
have already described, I would have the Courtier strive, with
all the thoughts and forces of his mind, to love and almost to
adore the prince whom he serves, above every other thing, and
mould his wishes, habits and all his ways to his prince’s liking.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Without waiting for more, Pietro da Napoli here said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“We already have enough Courtiers of this kind, for methinks
you have in a few words described for us a noble flatterer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are much in errour,” replied messer Federico; “for
flatterers love neither their prince nor their friends, which I tell
you I wish chiefly in our Courtier.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Moreover it is possible without flattery to obey and further
the wishes of him we serve, for I am speaking of those wishes
that are reasonable and right, or of those that in themselves are
neither good nor evil, such as would be a liking for play or a devotion
to one kind of exercise above another. And I would have
the Courtier bend himself to this even if he be by nature alien to it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>so that on seeing him his lord shall always feel that he will have
something agreeable to say; which will come about if he has the
good judgment to perceive what his prince likes, and the wit and
prudence to bend himself thereto, and a deliberate purpose to
like that which perhaps he by nature dislikes. And adopting
these precautions, he will never be out of humour or melancholy
before his prince, nor so taciturn as many are who seem to bear
a grudge against their patrons, which is a truly odious thing.
He will not be given to evil speaking, especially against his
own lords; which often happens, for in courts there seems to
rage a fury<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c016'><sup>[161]</sup></a> of such sort that those who have been most favoured
by their lord and have been raised to eminence from
the lowest state, are always complaining and speaking ill of
him; which is unseemly not only in such as these, but even in
those who chance to have been ill used.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Our Courtier will show no foolish presumption; he will not
be a bearer of evil tidings; he will not be thoughtless in sometimes
saying things that offend instead of pleasing as he intends.
He will not be obstinate and disputatious, as some are who
seem to delight in nothing but to be troublesome and disagreeable
like flies, and who make a point of spitefully contradicting everyone
without discrimination. He will not be an idle or untruthful
tattler, nor a boaster nor pointless flatterer, but modest and
reserved, always and especially in public showing that reverence
and respect which befit the servant towards the master; and he
will not behave like many, who on meeting any great prince,
with whom if only they have spoken but once, press forward
with a certain smiling and friendly look, as if they wished to
caress an equal or show favour to an inferior.</p>

<p class='c001'>“He will very rarely or almost never ask anything of his lord
for himself, lest his lord, being reluctant to deny it to him
directly, may sometimes grant it with an ill grace, which is
much worse. Even in asking for others he will choose his time
discreetly and ask proper and reasonable things; and he will so
frame his request, by omitting what he knows may displease and
by skilfully doing away with difficulties, that his lord shall always
grant it, or shall not think him offended by refusal even if
it be denied; for when lords have denied a favour to an importunate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>suitor, they often reflect that he who asked it with such
eagerness, must have desired it greatly, and so having failed to
obtain it, must feel ill will towards him who denied it; and believing
this, they begin to hate the man and can never more look
upon him with favour.</p>

<p class='c001'>19.—“He will not seek to intrude unasked into his master’s
chamber or private retreats, even though he be of great consequence;
for when great lords are in private, they often like a
little liberty to say and do what they please, and do not wish to
be seen or heard by any who may criticise them; and it is very
proper. Hence I think those men do ill who blame great lords
for consorting privately with persons who are of little worth
save in matters of personal service, for I do not see why lords
should not have the same freedom to relax their minds that we
fain would have to relax ours. But if a Courtier accustomed to
deal with important matters, chances to find himself in private
with his lord, he must put on another face, postpone grave concerns
to another place and time, and give the conversation a
cast that shall amuse and please his lord, so as not to disturb
that repose of mind of which I speak.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In this however, as in everything else, let him above all take
care not to weary his lord, and let him wait for favours to be
offered him rather than angle for them so openly as many do,
who are so greedy that it seems as if they must die if they do not
get what they seek; and if they happen to meet any disfavour
or to see others favoured, they suffer such anguish that they can
in no wise hide their envy. Thus they make everyone laugh at
them, and often are the cause that leads their master to bestow
favour on the first comer simply to spite them. Then again, if
they find themselves in at all more than common favour, they
become so intoxicated by it that they stand palsied<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c016'><sup>[162]</sup></a> with joy,
and seem not to know what to do with their hands and feet, and
they can hardly keep from calling on the company to come and
see and congratulate them as upon something to which they are
quite unused.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of such sort I would not have our Courtier. I am quite
willing that he should like favours, but not that he should value
them so highly as to seem unable to do without them. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>when he receives them, let him not seem unused or strange to
them, or marvel that they are offered him; nor let him refuse
them, as some do who refrain from accepting them out of mere
ignorance, and thus seem to the bystanders to be conscious of
not deserving them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yet a man ought always to be a little more backward than
his rank warrants; to accept not too readily the favours and honours
that are offered him; and to refuse them modestly, showing
that he values them highly, yet in such fashion as to give the
donor cause to offer them again with far more urgency. For
the greater the reluctance with which they are accepted, the
more highly will the prince who gives them think himself esteemed,
and the benefit that he bestows will seem the greater,
the more the recipient seems to prize it and to hold himself honoured
by it. Moreover these are the true and solid favours that
make a man esteemed by those who see him from without; for,
being unsought, they are assumed by everyone to be the reward
of true worth, the more so when they are accompanied by
modesty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>20.—Then messer Cesare Gonzaga said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Methinks you have stolen this passage from the Evangelist,
where he says: ‘When thou art bidden to a wedding, go and sit
down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh,
he may say: Friend, go up higher: and thus shalt thou
have honour in the presence of them that sit at meat with
thee.’”<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c016'><sup>[163]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Federico laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It were too great sacrilege to steal from the Evangelist; but
you are more learned in Holy Writ than I thought;” then he
went on: “You see what great danger those men sometimes run
who boldly begin conversation before a lord without being invited;
and to put them down, the lord often makes no reply and
turns his head another way, and even if he replies to them,
everyone sees that he does it with an ill grace.</p>

<p class='c001'>“To have the favour of princes, then, there is no better way
than to deserve it. And when we see another man who is
pleasing to a prince for any reason, we must not think to reach
the same height ourselves by imitating him, for all things are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>not proper to all men. Thus there will sometimes be found a
man who by nature is so ready at jesting that whatever he may
say carries laughter with it, and he seems to have been born
solely for that; and if another man, who has a sober habit of
mind (however excellently endowed) tries to do the like, it will
fall so cold and flat as to disgust those who hear him, and he
will prove exactly like that ass who tried to copy the dog by
frolicking with their master.<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c016'><sup>[164]</sup></a> Hence every man must understand
himself and his own powers, and govern himself accordingly,
and consider what things he ought to imitate, and what
things he ought not.”</p>

<p class='c001'>21.—Here Vincenzo Calmeta said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Before you go on, if I heard aright I think you said awhile
ago that the best way to win favours is to deserve them, and
that the Courtier ought to wait for them to be offered him
rather than ask for them presumptuously. I greatly fear this
rule is little to the purpose, and I think experience very clearly
teaches us the contrary. For to-day very few are favoured by
their lords, save the presumptuous; and I know you can give
good testimony as to some, who on finding themselves in small
favour with their princes, have made themselves acceptable solely
by their presumption. While as for those who have risen
through modesty, I for my part do not know any, and I even
give you time to think about it and believe you will find few.
And if you consider the court of France, which is to-day one of
the noblest in Christendom, you will find that all men who have
universal favour there are somewhat presumptuous, and not only
towards one another but towards the king himself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now do not say that,” replied messer Federico; “for in France
there are very modest and courteous gentlemen. It is true that
they behave with a certain freedom and unceremonious familiarity,
which are proper and natural to them; and therefore it
ought not to be called presumption, because in this very manner
of theirs, whilst they deride and make sport of the presumptuous,
yet they rate highly those who seem to them to
have worth and modesty.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Calmeta replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Look at the Spaniards, who it seems are our masters in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Courtiership, and consider how many you will find who are
not very presumptuous with ladies and with gentlemen; and
even more so than the French, because at first sight they show
the greatest modesty. And in this they are truly clever, for as I
said, the princes of our time all favour only those who have such
manners.”</p>

<p class='c001'>22.—Then messer Federico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will by no means suffer you, messer Vincenzo, to cast this
reproach upon the princes of our time. For indeed there are
also many who love modesty, which I do not however say alone
suffices to make a man acceptable; but I do say that when
united to high worth, it greatly honours its possessor. And although
it be silent about itself, praiseworthy deeds speak aloud
and are far more admirable than if they were accompanied by
presumption and rashness. I will not indeed deny that there are
many presumptuous Spaniards, but I say that those who are
much esteemed are as a rule very modest.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Again, there are also some men who are so reserved that
they shun human company beyond reason, and so far exceed a
certain limit of moderation that they come to be regarded as
either too timid or too proud. For these I have no praise, nor
would I have modesty so dry and arid as to become clownishness;
but let the Courtier be fluent on occasion, and prudent and
sagacious in discussing statecraft, and let him have the good
sense to adapt himself to the customs of the nations where he
finds himself; then in lesser matters let him be agreeable and
speak well about everything.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But above all, he should make for right; not envious, not
evil-tongued: nor let him ever bring himself to seek grace or favour
by foul ways or dishonourable means.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Calmeta said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I assure you that all other ways are more uncertain and
longer than this one which you censure. For to repeat, princes
at the present day love only those who tread that path.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Say not so,” then replied messer Federico, “for that would
be too clear an argument that the princes of our time are all
vicious and wicked,—which is not true, since several good ones
are to be found. But if our Courtier should chance to find himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>in the service of one who is vicious and malign, let him
depart as soon as he discovers it, lest he suffer that keen anguish
which all good men feel who serve the wicked.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We must needs pray God,” replied Calmeta, “to send us
good masters, for when we have them, we are forced to endure
them such as they are; because an infinity of reasons constrain
a gentleman not to leave the patron he has once begun to serve;
but the misfortune consists in beginning to serve a bad patron,
and Courtiers in this condition are like those unhappy birds that
are hatched in a gloomy valley.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It seems to me,” said messer Federico, “that duty ought to
outweigh all other reasons. And provided a gentleman does not
leave his patron when at war or in adversity,—lest he be
thought to have done so to better his fortunes or because he
feared that he might lack opportunity for gain,—I think that at
any other time he rightly may and ought to leave a service that
is like to disgrace him before all good men; for everyone assumes
that whoever serves the good is good, and that whoever
serves the wicked is wicked.”</p>

<p class='c001'>23.—Then my lord Ludovico Pio said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should like to have you clear a doubt that is in my mind;
that is, whether a gentleman in the service of a prince is bound
to obey him in all things that he commands, even if they be dishonourable
and infamous.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“In dishonourable things we are not bound to obey any man,”
replied messer Federico.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And how,” returned my lord Ludovico, “if I am in the service
of a prince who uses me well and trusts to my doing for
him all that can be done, commanding me to go kill a man or do
anything else you please,—ought I to refuse to do it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You ought,” replied messer Federico, “to obey your lord in
all things that are advantageous and honourable to him, not in
those that bring him injury and disgrace. Therefore if he were
to command you to commit an act of treachery, not only would
you not be bound to do it, but you would be bound not to do it,—both
for your own sake and for the sake of not being a minister
to your lord’s disgrace. True it is that many things which are
evil seem at first sight good, and many seem evil and yet are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>good. Hence in our lords’ service it is sometimes permitted to
kill not one man but ten thousand, and to do many other things
that would seem evil to a man who did not rightly consider
them, and yet are not evil.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lord Gaspar Pallavicino replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“On your faith, I pray you discuss this a little, and teach us
how the really good can be distinguished from that which only
seems so.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Pardon me,” said messer Federico; “I am unwilling to enter
upon that, for there would be too much to say; but let the whole
matter be left to your own wisdom.”</p>

<p class='c001'>24.—“At least clear another doubt for me,” returned my lord
Gaspar.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what doubt?” said messer Federico.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is this,” replied my lord Gaspar. “I should like to know,—my
lord having charged me exactly what I must do in an enterprise
or any other business whatever, if I being engaged upon it
think that my doing more or less or otherwise than I was
charged, may make the affair turn out better and more advantageously
for him who gave me the task,—whether I ought to
govern myself by the original plan without exceeding the limits
of my command, or on the contrary to do that which seems to
me better.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Federico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“In this I should give you the precept and example of Manlius
Torquatus (who in like case slew his son, from too stern a
sense of duty), if I thought he deserved much credit, which I do
not.<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c016'><sup>[165]</sup></a> And yet I dare not blame him against the verdict of so
many centuries. For without doubt it is a very perilous thing
to deviate from our superiors’ commands, relying more on our
own judgment than on theirs whom we ought in reason to obey;
because if our expectation fails and the affair turns out ill, we
run into the errour of disobedience and ruin that which we have
to do, without any possibility of excuse or hope of pardon. On
the other hand, if the affair turns out according to our wish, we
must give the credit to fortune and be content at that. Moreover
in this way a fashion is set of rating the commands of our
superiors lightly; and following the example of one man who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>happened to succeed and who perhaps was prudent and had
reasoned well and been aided by fortune too,—a thousand other
ignorant featherheads will make bold to do as they please in the
most important matters, and for the sake of showing that they
are sagacious and have authority, to deviate from their masters’
commands; which is a very evil thing and often the cause of
numberless mistakes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But I think that in such a case the man whom it concerns
ought to consider carefully, and as it were to place in the balance
the profit and advantage that he stands to win by acting contrary
to orders, in case his design turns out according to his hopes;
and on the other hand to weigh the evil and disadvantage that
will accrue if the affair chances to turn out ill through his disobedience
of orders. And if he finds the damage in case of
failure to be greater and more serious than the gain in case of
success, he ought to restrain himself and carry out his orders to
the letter; while on the contrary if the gain in case of success is
like to be more serious than the damage in case of failure, I
think he may properly venture to do that which his reason and
judgment dictate, and somewhat disregard the very letter of his
orders,—so as to act like good merchants, who to gain much
risk little, but never risk much to gain little.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I strongly approve of the Courtier’s observing above all the
character of the prince whom he serves, and of his governing
himself accordingly: for if it be severe, as is the case with many,
I should never advise anyone who was my friend to change one
jot the order given him; lest that might befall him which is recorded
as having befallen a master engineer of the Athenians, to
whom Publius Crassus Mucianus,<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c016'><sup>[166]</sup></a> when he was in Asia and
wished to besiege a fortified place, sent to ask for one of two
ship’s masts that he had seen at Athens, in order to make a ram
wherewith to batter down the wall, and said he wished the
larger one. Being very intelligent, the engineer knew that the
larger mast was unsuitable for the purpose, and as the smaller
one was easier to transport and better adapted for making the
machine in question, he sent it to Mucianus. The latter, hearing
how things had gone, sent for the poor engineer, asked why he
had disobeyed his orders, and refusing to listen to any excuse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>from him, caused him to be stripped naked and so flogged and
scourged with rods that he died, because it seemed to Mucianus
that instead of obeying, the man had tried to offer advice. So
we had best use great caution with these rigourous men.</p>

<p class='c001'>25.—“But now let us leave this subject of intercourse with
princes, and come to conversation with our equals or with
those that are nearly so: for we must pay heed to this also,
since it is universally more practised and a man more often
finds himself engaged in it than in conversation with princes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are however some simpletons, who, even in the company
of the best friend they have in the world, on meeting a
man who is better dressed, at once attach themselves to him,
and then if they happen on one still better dressed, they do the
like to him. And later, when the prince is passing through the
squares or churches or other public places, they elbow their
way past everyone until they reach his side: and even if they
have naught to say to him, they still must talk, and go on babbling,
and laugh and clap their hands and head, to show they
have business of importance, so that the crowd may see them in
favour. But since these fellows deign to speak only with their
lords, I would not have us deign to speak of them.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec2.26'></a>26.—Then the Magnifico Giuliano said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“As you have mentioned those who are so fond of the company
of well dressed men, I should like you to show us, messer
Federico, in what manner the Courtier ought to dress, and what
costume is suitable to him, and in what way he ought to govern
himself in all matters of bodily adornment. For in this we find
an infinite variety: some who dress after the French fashion,
some after the Spanish, some who wish to appear German; nor
is <a id='corr102.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='their'>there</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_102.30'><ins class='correction' title='their'>there</ins></a></span> lack of those who even dress after the style of Turks:
some who wear their beards, some not. Hence in this medley it
were well to know how to choose the best.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Federico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed I should not know how to give a precise rule about
dress, except that a man ought to follow the custom of the majority;
and since (as you say) this custom is so various, and the
Italians are so fond of arraying themselves after foreign fashions,
I think every man may dress as he pleases.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>“But I do not know by what fate it happens that Italy has not,
as it was wont to have, a costume that should be recognized as
Italian: for although the putting of these new fashions into use
may have made the former ones seem very rude, yet the old
ones were perhaps a badge of freedom, as the new ones have
proved an augury of servitude, which I think is now very clearly
fulfilled.<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c016'><sup>[167]</sup></a> And as it is recorded that when Darius had the Persian
sword which he wore at his side fashioned after the Macedonian
style, the year before he fought with Alexander, this was
interpreted by the soothsayers to signify that they into whose
fashion Darius had transformed his Persian sword, should come
to rule over Persia.<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c016'><sup>[168]</sup></a> So our having changed our Italian garb
for that of strangers seems to signify that all those for whose
garb we have exchanged our own must come to conquer us:
which has been but too true, for there is now left no nation that
has not made us its prey: so that little more is left to prey upon,
and yet they do not cease preying upon us.</p>

<p class='c001'>27.—“But I do not wish to touch on painful subjects. Therefore
it will be well to speak of our Courtier’s clothes; which I
think, provided they be not out of the common or inappropriate
to his profession, may do very well in other respects if only they
satisfy him who wears them. True it is that I for my part
should not like them to be extreme in any wise, as the French
are sometimes wont to be in over amplitude, and the Germans
in over scantiness,—but as they both are, only corrected and
improved in form by the Italians. Moreover I always like them
to tend a little towards the grave and sober rather than the gay.
Thus I think black is more suitable for garments than any other
colour is; and if it is not black, let it at least be somewhat dark.
And this I say of ordinary attire, for there is no doubt that
bright and cheerful colours are more suitable over armour, and
for gala use also dress may be fringed, showy and magnificent;
likewise on public occasions, such as festivals, shows, masquerades,
and the like. For such garments carry with them a certain
liveliness and gaiety that accord very well with arms and
sports. But for the rest I would have our Courtier’s dress display
that sobriety which the Spanish nation greatly affect, for
things external often bear witness to the things within.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Then messer Cesare Gonzaga said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“This would give me little concern, for if a gentleman is of
worth in other things, his attire will never enhance or lessen his
reputation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You say truly,” replied messer Federico. “Yet what one of
us is there, who, on seeing a gentleman pass by with a garment
on his back quartered in divers colours, or with a mass of strings
and knotted ribbons and cross lacings, does not take him for a
fool or a buffoon?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Neither for a fool,” said messer Pietro Bembo, “nor for a
buffoon would he be taken by anyone who had lived any time in
Lombardy, for all men go about like that.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then,” said my lady Duchess, laughing, “if all men go about
like that, we must not cast it at them as a fault, since this attire
is as fitting and proper to them as it is for the Venetians to wear
puffed sleeves,<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c016'><sup>[169]</sup></a> or for the Florentines to wear the hood.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am not speaking,” said messer Federico, “more of Lombardy
than of other places, for both the foolish and the wise are
to be found in every nation. But to say what I think is important
in attire, I wish that our Courtier may be neat and dainty
throughout his dress, and have a certain air of modest elegance,
yet not of a womanish or vain style. Nor would I have him
more careful of one thing than of another, like many we see
who take such pains with their hair that they forget the rest;
others devote themselves to their teeth, others to their beard,
others to their boots, others to their bonnets, others to their
coifs;<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c016'><sup>[170]</sup></a> and the result is that these few details of elegance seem
borrowed by them, while all the rest, being very tasteless, is
recognized as their own. And this kind of dress I would have
our Courtier shun, by my advice; adding also that he ought to
consider how he wishes to seem and of what sort he wishes to
be esteemed, and to dress accordingly and contrive that his
attire shall aid him to be so regarded even by those who neither
hear him speak nor witness any act of his.”</p>

<p class='c001'>28.—Then my lord Gaspar Pallavicino said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Methinks it is not fitting, or even customary among persons
of worth, to judge men’s quality by their dress rather than by
their words and acts; for many would make mistakes, nor is it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>without reason that we have the proverb, ‘dress makes not the
monk.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not say,” replied messer Federico, “that fixed opinions
of men’s worth are to be formed only in this way, or that they
are not better known by their words and acts than by their
dress: but I do say that dress is no bad index of the wearer’s
fancy, although it may be sometimes wrong; and not only this,
but all ways and manners, as well as acts and words, are an indication
of the qualities of the man in whom they are seen.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what things do you find,” replied my lord Gaspar, “from
which we may form an opinion, that are neither words nor
acts?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Federico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are too subtle a logician. But to tell you what I mean,
there are some acts that still endure after they are performed,
such as building, writing, and the like; others do not endure,
such as those I have now in mind. In this sense, therefore, I do
not say that walking, laughing, looking, and the like, are acts,—and
yet all these outward things often give knowledge of those
within. Tell me, did you not judge that friend of ours, of whom
we were speaking only this morning, to be a light and frivolous
man as soon as you saw him walking with that twist of his head,
wriggling about, and with affable demeanour inviting the by-standers
to doff their caps to him? So, too, when you see anyone
gazing too intently with dull eyes after the manner of an idiot, or
laughing as stupidly as those goitrous mutes in the mountains of
Bergamo,<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c016'><sup>[171]</sup></a>—do you not set him down a very simpleton, although
he neither speak nor do aught else? Thus you see that these
ways and manners (which I do not for the present regard as
acts) in great measure make men known to us.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec2.29'></a>29.—“But another thing seems to me to give and to take away
from reputation greatly, and this is our choice of the friends with
whom we are to live in intimate relations; for doubtless reason
requires that they who are joined in close amity and fast companionship,
shall have their desires, souls, judgments and minds
also in accord. Thus, he who consorts with the ignorant or
wicked, is deemed ignorant or wicked; and on the contrary, he
who consorts with the good, the wise, and the discreet, is himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>deemed to be the like. Because by nature everything seems to
join willingly with its like. Therefore I think we ought to use
great care in beginning these friendships, for he who knows one
of two close friends, at once imagines the other to be of the same
quality.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Pietro Bembo replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I certainly think we ought to take great care to limit ourselves
to friends of like mind with us, as you say, not only because
of the gain or loss of reputation, but because there are to-day
very few true friends to be found, nor do I believe that the world
any longer contains a Pylades and Orestes, a Theseus and Pirithous,
or a Scipio and Lælius.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c016'><sup>[172]</sup></a> On the contrary, by some fatality
it happens every day that two friends, who have lived in very
cordial love for many years, yet in some way cheat each other
at last, either through malice, or jealousy, or fickleness, or some
other evil cause: and each gives the other the blame which perhaps
both deserve.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore, since it has more than once happened to me to be
deceived by him whom I most loved above every other person,
and by whom I was sure I was loved,—I have sometimes thought
to myself that it would be well for us never to trust anyone in
the world, nor so to give ourselves up to any friend (however
dear and loved he be) as to reveal all our thoughts to him, as we
should to ourselves; for there are so many dark corners and recesses
in our minds that it is impossible for human wit to penetrate
the deceptions they conceal. Hence I think it were well to
love and serve one more than another according to merit and
worth; yet never to be so sure of friendship’s sweet enticement,
that we at last have cause to rue our trust.”</p>

<p class='c001'>30.—Then messer Federico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Verily the loss would be far greater than the gain, if human
intercourse were to be deprived of that highest pitch of friendship
which in my opinion gives us all the good our life has in it; and
therefore I will in no wise admit that what you say is reasonable,
nay rather I venture to assert, and for the clearest reasons, that
without this perfect friendship men would be far unhappier than
all other creatures. And if some profanely stain this sacred name
of friendship, we ought not on that account to uproot it from our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>hearts, and for the guilt of the wicked deprive the good of such
felicity. And for my part I think there are here among us more
than one pair of friends, whose love is steadfast and without deceit
and lasting unto death with like desires, no less than if they
were those ancients whom you mentioned awhile ago; and it
happens thus when a man chooses a friend, not only from heaven-born
impulse, but like himself in character. And in all this I am
speaking of the good and virtuous, for the friendship of the
wicked is not friendship.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am well pleased that so close a tie as this should not join or
bind more than two, for otherwise perhaps it would be dangerous;
because, as you know, it is harder to attune three musical
instruments together, than two. Therefore, I would that our
Courtier might have one special and hearty friend, if possible, of
the kind we have described; then that he might love, honour and
respect all others according to their worth and merits, and always
contrive to consort more with such as are in high esteem and
noble and of known virtue, than with the ignoble and those of
little worth; in such wise that he may be loved and honoured
by them also. And he will accomplish this if he be courteous,
kind, generous, affable and mild with others, zealous and active
to serve and guard his friends’ welfare and honour both
absent and present, enduring such of their natural defects as
are endurable, without breaking with them for slight cause,
and correcting in himself those that are kindly pointed out;
never thrusting himself before others to reach the first and
most honoured places; nor acting like some, who seem to despise
the world and insist with a kind of tiresome preciseness
on laying down the law for everyone, and who, besides being
unseasonably contentious in every little thing, censure that which
they do not do themselves, and are always seeking occasion for
complaint against their friends,—which is a very odious thing.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec2.31'></a>31.—Messer Federico pausing here, my lord Gaspar Pallavicino
said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should like to have you speak a little more in detail than
you do about this matter of converse with our friends; for in
truth you keep much to generalities, and show us things in
passing, as it were.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“How ‘in passing’?” replied messer Federico. “Perhaps you
would have me tell the very words that you must use? Do you
not think we have talked enough about this?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Enough I think,” replied my lord Gaspar. “Yet I should
like to hear a few more details about the manner of intercourse
with men and women; for the thing seems to me of great
importance, seeing that most of our time at courts is given to
it; and if it were always the same, it would soon become tedious.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think,” replied messer Federico, “we have given the Courtier
knowledge of so many things, that he can easily vary his
conversation and adapt himself to the quality of the persons
with whom he has to do, presupposing he has good sense and
governs himself by it, and sometimes turns to grave matters and
sometimes to festivals and games, according to the occasion.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what games?” said my lord Gaspar.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Federico replied, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let us ask advice of Fra Serafino, who invents new ones
every day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Jesting apart,” answered my lord Gaspar, “do you think it
would be a vice in the Courtier to play at cards and dice?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not I,” said messer Federico, “unless he did so too constantly
and neglected more important matters for them, or indeed
unless he played for nothing else but to win money, and
cheated the company, and showed such grief and vexation at
losing as to argue himself a miser.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what,” replied my lord Gaspar, “do you say of the
game of chess?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is certainly a pleasant and ingenious amusement,” said
messer Federico. “But I think there is one defect in it. And
that is, there is too much to know, so that whoever would excel
in the game of chess must spend much time on it, methinks, and
give it as much study as if he would learn some noble science
or do anything else of importance you please; and yet in the end
with all his pains he has learned nothing but a game. Therefore
I think a very unusual thing is true of it, namely that mediocrity
is more praiseworthy than excellence.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Gaspar replied:</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>“Many Spaniards excel in this and divers other games, yet
without giving them much study or neglecting other things.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Believe me,” replied messer Federico, “they do give much
study thereto, although covertly. But those other games you
speak of, besides chess, are perhaps like many I have seen
played (although of little moment), which serve only to make
the vulgar marvel; wherefore methinks they deserve no other
praise or reward than that which Alexander the Great gave the
fellow who at a good distance impaled chick-peas on the point
of a needle.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c016'><sup>[173]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec2.32'></a>32.—“But since it appears that fortune exerts immense power
over men’s opinions as over many other things, we sometimes
see that a gentleman, however well conditioned he may be and
endowed with many graces, is unacceptable to a prince, and
goes against the grain as we say;<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c016'><sup>[174]</sup></a> and this without any apparent
reason, so that as soon as he comes into the prince’s
presence and before he is known by the others, although he be
keen and ready with retorts, and display himself to advantage in
gestures, manners, words, and all else that is becoming,—the
prince will show small esteem for him, nay will soon put some
affront upon him. And thus it will come about that the others
will follow the prince’s lead, and everyone will regard the man
as of little worth, nor will there be any to prize or esteem him,
or laugh at his amusing talk or hold him in any respect; nay, all
will begin to deride and persecute him. Nor will it be enough
for the poor man to make good retorts or take things as if said
in jest, for the very pages will set upon him, so that even if he
were the sturdiest man in the world, he must perforce remain
foiled and ridiculed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And on the other hand, if the prince shows favour to a very
dolt, who knows neither how to speak nor how to act,—his manners
and ways (however silly and uncouth they be) will often be
praised by everyone with exclamations and astonishment, and
the whole court will seem to admire and respect him, and everyone
will appear to laugh at his jests and at certain rustic and
stupid jokes that ought to excite rather disgust than laughter: to
such degree are men firm and fixed in the opinions that are engendered
by the favour and disfavour of lords.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“Therefore I would have our Courtier set off his worth as
best he can, with cleverness and skill, and whenever he has to
go where he is strange and unknown, let him take care that
good opinion of him precedes him, and see to it that men there
shall know of his being highly rated in other places, among
other lords, ladies and gentlemen; for that fame which seems to
spring from many judgments, begets a kind of firm belief in a
man’s worth, which, in minds thus disposed and prepared, is
then easily maintained and increased by his conduct: moreover
he escapes that annoyance which I feel when asked who I am
and what my name is.”</p>

<p class='c001'>33.—“I do not see how this can help,” replied messer Bernardo
Bibbiena; “for it has several times happened to me, and
I think to many others, that having been led by the word of persons
of judgment to imagine something to be of great excellence
before I saw it,—on seeing it I found it paltry and was much
disappointed of what I expected. And the reason was simply
that I had put too much trust in report and formed in my mind
so high an expectation, that although the real thing was great
and excellent, yet when afterwards measured by the fact, it
seemed very paltry by comparison with what I had imagined.
And I fear it may be so with our Courtier too. Therefore I do
not see the advantage of raising such expectations and sending
our fame before us; for the mind often imagines things that it is
impossible to fulfil, and thus we lose more than we gain.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here messer Federico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“The things that you and many others find inferior to their
reputation, are for the most part of such sort that the eye can
judge of them at a glance,—as if you had never been at Naples
or Rome, and from hearing them so much talked of, you were to
imagine something far beyond what they afterwards proved to
be when seen; but such is not the case with men’s character, because
that which is outwardly seen is the least part. Thus, on
first hearing a gentleman speak, if you should not find in him that
worth which you had previously imagined, you would not at
once reverse your good opinion of him, as you would in those
matters whereof the eye is instant judge, but you would wait
from day to day to discover some other hidden virtue, still holding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>fast to the good impression you had received from so many
lips; and later, if he were thus richly endowed (as I assume our
Courtier to be), your confidence in his reputation would be hourly
confirmed, because his acts would justify it, and you would be
always imagining something more than you saw.</p>

<p class='c001'>34.—“And surely it cannot be denied that these first impressions
have very great weight, and that we ought to be very careful
regarding them. And to the end that you may see how important
they are, I tell you that in my time I knew a gentleman, who,
while he was of very gentle aspect and modest manners and also
valiant in arms, yet did not so greatly excel in any of these things
but that he had many equals and even superiors. However, fate
so willed that a lady chanced to fall most ardently in love with
him, and her love increasing daily with the signs that the young
man gave of loving her in return, and there being no way for
them to speak together, she was moved by excess of passion to
reveal her desires to another lady through whom she hoped to
secure some assistance. This lady was in no wise inferior to the
first in rank or beauty; whence it came to pass, that on hearing
the young man (whom she had never seen) spoken of so
tenderly, and perceiving that he was extravagantly loved by
her friend (whom she knew to be very discreet and of excellent
judgment), she straightway imagined him to be the handsomest
and wisest and most discreet and in short the most
lovable man in the world. And thus, without having seen him,
she became so passionately enamoured of him, that she began
making every effort to secure him, not for her friend but for
herself, and inducing him to return her love: which she succeeded
in doing with little effort, for in truth she was a lady
rather to be wooed than to woo others.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now hear the end of my tale. Not long afterwards it happened
that a letter, which this second lady had written to her
lover, fell into the hands of still another lady, also very noble
and of good character and rarest beauty,—who, being like most
ladies curious and eager to learn secrets and especially other
ladies’, opened this letter, and on reading it saw that it was
written with the fervour of ardent love. And the sweet, impassioned
words that she read first moved her to compassion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>for that lady, for she well knew from whom the letter came
and to whom it was going; then they gained such power, that
as she turned them over in her mind and considered what sort
of man he must be who could arouse such love in the lady,
she too straightway fell in love with him; and the letter had
perhaps a greater effect than if it had been sent by the young
man to her. And as it sometimes happens that a poisoned
dish, intended for a prince, kills the first comer who tastes it,
so in her over greediness this poor lady drank the love poison
that had been prepared for another.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What more shall I say? The affair became well known,
and spread abroad so that many other ladies besides these,
partly to spite the others and partly to imitate them, used every
effort and pains to possess themselves of the man’s love, and
contended for it with one another as boys contend for cherries.
And all this began with the first impression of that lady who saw
him so beloved by another.”</p>

<p class='c001'>35.—Here my lord Gaspar Pallavicino replied, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“To give reasons in support of your opinion, you cite the
doings of women, who for the most part are quite unreasonable.
And if you cared to tell the whole truth, this favourite of so
many women must have been a dunce and at bottom a man of
little worth. For their way is always to favour the meanest, and
like sheep to do what they see others doing, whether it be good or
evil. Moreover they are so jealous among themselves, that even
if the man had been a monster, they would have tried to steal
him from one another.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here many began to speak, and nearly everyone wanted to
contradict my lord Gaspar; but my lady Duchess imposed
silence on all, and then said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“If the evil you say of women were not so far from the truth,
that the saying of it casts blame and shame on him who says it
rather than on them, I should allow you to be answered. But I
am not willing that, by being confronted with the arguments
which it is possible to cite, you should be cured of this evil
habit, in order that you may suffer very grievous punishment
for your fault: which shall be the bad opinion wherein you will be
held by all who hear you argue in such fashion.”</p>

</div>
</div>

“Leo X’s Entry into Florence,” in the Palazzo Vecchio at Florence, by Giorgio Vasari
(1511-1574). See Milanesi’s edition of Vasari’s <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Opere</cite></span>, viii, 142.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Then messer Federico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My lord Gaspar, do not say that women are so very unreasonable,
even if they are sometimes moved to love by others’
judgment rather than by their own; for gentlemen and many
wise men do the same. And if I may say the truth, you yourself
and all the rest of us here do often and even now trust more
to the opinion of others than to our own. And in proof of this,
it is not long ago that certain verses, handed about this court
under the name of Sannazaro,<a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c016'><sup>[175]</sup></a> seemed very excellent to everyone
and were praised with wonder and applause; then, it being
known for certain that they were by another hand, they promptly
sank in reputation and were thought less than mediocre. And a
certain motet,<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c016'><sup>[176]</sup></a> which was sung before my lady Duchess, found
no favour and was not thought good until it was known to be the
work of Josquin de Près.<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c016'><sup>[177]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“What clearer proof of the weight of opinion would you have?
Do you not remember that in drinking a certain wine, you at one
time pronounced it perfect, and at another most insipid? And
this because you believed there were two kinds of wine, one
from the Genoese Riviera, and the other from this country; and
even when the mistake was discovered, you would not at all believe
it,—so firmly fixed in your mind was that wrong opinion,
although you had received it from the report of others.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec2.36'></a>36.—“Hence the Courtier ought to take great care to make a
good impression at the start, and to consider how mischievous
and fatal a thing it is to do otherwise. And they of all men run
this danger, who pride themselves on being very amusing and
on having acquired by these pleasantries of theirs a certain freedom
that makes it proper and permissible for them to do and
say whatever occurs to them, without taking thought about it.
Thus they often begin a thing they know not how to finish, and
then try to help matters by raising a laugh; and yet they do
this so clumsily that it does not succeed, insomuch that they
rouse the utmost disgust in him who sees or hears them, and fail
most lamentably.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sometimes, thinking it to be droll and witty, they say the
foulest and most indecent things before and even to honourable
ladies; and the more they make these ladies blush, the more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>they rate themselves good Courtiers, and they laugh and pride
themselves on having such a fine accomplishment, as they deem
it. Yet they commit all this folly with no other aim than to be
esteemed jovial fellows: this is the one name which seems to
them worthy of praise and of which they boast more than of
any other; and to acquire it, they utter the grossest and most
shameful vileness in the world. Often they throw one another
down-stairs, clap billets of wood and bricks on one another’s
backs, cast handfulls of dust in one another’s eyes, make one
another’s horses run into ditches or down some hill; then at
table they throw soups, sauces, jellies and every kind of thing in
one another’s faces:<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c016'><sup>[178]</sup></a> and then they laugh. And he who can
excel the others in these things, esteems himself to be the best
Courtier and the most gallant, and thinks he has won great
glory. And if they sometimes invite a gentleman to these
carouses of theirs, and he does not choose to join in their unmannerly
jokes, they at once say he stands too much on his
dignity, and holds himself aloof, and is not a jovial fellow. But
I have worse to tell you. There are some who rival one another
and award the palm to him who can eat and drink the
vilest and most offensive things; and they devise dishes so abhorrent
to human sense that it is impossible to recall them without
extreme disgust.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec2.37'></a>37.—“And what may these be?” said my lord Ludovico Pio.</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Federico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ask the Marquess Febus, who has often seen them in
France, and perhaps has taken part.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Marquess Febus replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have seen none of these things done in France that are not
done in Italy as well. But what is good among the Italians in
dress, sports, banquets, handling arms, and in everything else
that befits a Courtier,—all comes from the French.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Federico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not say that very noble and modest cavaliers are not
also to be found among the French, and I myself have known
many who were truly worthy of every praise. But some are
little circumspect, and generally speaking it seems to me that as
regards breeding the Spaniards have more in common with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Italians than the French have; because that grave reserve
peculiar to the Spaniards befits us far more than the quick
vivacity which among the French we see in almost every
movement, and which is not unseemly in them, nay is charming,
for it is so natural and proper to them as not to seem at all
affected. There are very many Italians who earnestly strive to
copy this manner; and they can only shake their heads in speaking
and make clumsy crosswise bows, and walk so fast that their
lackeys cannot keep up with them when they pass through the
city. And with these ways they seem to themselves to be good
Frenchmen and to have the same freedom of manner, which in
truth rarely happens save with those who have been bred in
France and have acquired the manner in their youth.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The same is true of knowing many languages; which I approve
highly in the Courtier, especially Spanish and French,
because the intercourse of both these nations with Italy is very
frequent, and they have more in common with us than any of the
others have; and their two princes,<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c016'><sup>[179]</sup></a> being very powerful in
war and very glorious in peace, always have their courts full of
noble cavaliers, who spread throughout the world; and it is
necessary for us also to converse with them.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec2.38'></a>38.—“I do not care at present to go more into detail in speaking
of things that are too well known, such as that our Courtier
ought not to avow himself a great eater or drinker, or given to
excess in any evil habit, or vile and ungoverned in his life, with
certain peasant ways that recall the hoe and plough a thousand
miles away; because a man of this kind not only may not hope
to become a good Courtier, but can be set to no more fitting
business than feeding sheep.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And finally I say it were well for the Courtier to know perfectly
that which we have said befits him, so that every possible
thing may be easy to him, and everyone may marvel at him,—he
at no one. But be it understood that there ought not to be in
him that lofty and ungenial indifference which some men have
who show they are not surprised at what others do because
they imagine they can do it better, and who disparage it by
silence as not worth speaking of; and they almost seem to imply
that no one is their equal or even able to fathom the profundity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>of their knowledge. Wherefore the Courtier ought to shun
these odious ways, and to praise the fine achievements of other
men with kindness and good will; and although he may feel that
he is admirable and far superior to all, yet he ought to appear
not to think so.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But since such complete perfection as this is very rarely and
perhaps never found in human nature, a man who is conscious
of being lacking in some particular, ought not to despond thereat
or lose hope of reaching a high standard, even though he cannot
attain that perfect and supreme excellence to which he aspires.
For in every art there are many grades that are honourable
besides the highest, and whoever aims at the highest will seldom
fail to rise more than half-way. Therefore if our Courtier
excels in anything besides arms, I would have him get profit and
esteem from it in fine fashion; and I would have him so discreet
and sensible as to be able with skill and address to attract
men to see and hear that wherein he thinks he excels, always
appearing not to do it from ostentation, but by chance and at
others’ request rather than by his own wish. And in everything
he has to do or say, let him if possible come ready and prepared,
yet appearing to act impromptu throughout. In those things,
however, wherein he feels himself to be mediocre, let him touch
in passing, without dwelling much upon them, albeit in such
fashion that he may be thought to know more about them than
he shows himself to know: like certain poets, who sometimes
touched lightly upon the profoundest depths of philosophy and
other sciences, of which perhaps they understood little. Then,
in that of which he knows he is wholly ignorant, I would never
have him make any pretence or seek to win any fame; nay if
need be, let him frankly confess his ignorance.”</p>

the Courtier should volunteer to tell his ignorance; for I too
dislike this folly of self-accusal and depreciation. And therefore
I sometimes inwardly laugh at certain men, who needlessly
and of their own accord narrate things that perhaps occurred
without their fault but yet imply a shade of disgrace; like a
cavalier whom you all know, and who, whenever he heard mention
made of the battle that was fought against King Charles
in the Parmesan,<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c016'><sup>[182]</sup></a> at once began to tell the manner of his
flight, nor seemed to have seen or heard aught else that day;
again, speaking of a certain famous joust, he always described
how he had fallen, and in his conversation he often seemed to
seek an opportunity to tell how he had received a sound cudgelling
one night as he was on his way to meet a lady.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I would not have our Courtier tell such follies. It seems to
me, however, that when occasion offers for displaying himself in
something of which he is quite ignorant, he ought to avoid it;
and if compelled by necessity, he ought to confess his ignorance
frankly rather than put himself to that risk. And in this way
he will escape the censure that many nowadays deserve, who
from some perverse instinct or unreasonable design always set
themselves to do that which they do not know, and forsake that
which they do know. And as an instance of this, I know a very
excellent musician, who, having abandoned music, gave himself
up wholly to composing verses, and thinks himself very great
therein, and makes all men laugh at him; and now he has lost
even his music.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Another man, one of the first painters of the world, despises
the art wherein he is most rare, and has set himself to study
philosophy; in which he has such strange conceptions and
new chimeras, that he could not with all his painter’s art depict
them.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c016'><sup>[183]</sup></a> And of such as these, a countless number could be
found.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Some indeed there are who know they excel in one thing
and yet make their chief business of another, of which they are
not ignorant either; but every time they have occasion to display
themselves in that wherein they feel themselves proficient, they
do it gallantly. And it sometimes comes to pass that the company,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>seeing them do well in that which is not their profession,
think they can do far better in that which they make their profession.
This art, if it be accompanied by good judgment, is by
no means unpleasing to me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>40.—Then my lord Gaspar Pallavicino replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“This seems to me not art but mere deceit; nor do I think
it fitting for him who would be a man of honour, ever to deceive.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is an embellishment, which graces what he does,” said
messer Federico, “rather than deceit; and even if it be deceit, it
is not to be censured. Will you not also say that of two men
fencing, the one who touches the other, deceives him? And
this is because the one has more art than the other. And if you
have a jewel that is beautiful without setting, and it afterwards
comes into the hands of a good goldsmith, who by skilful setting
makes it look far more beautiful, will you not say that this goldsmith
deceives the eyes of anyone who sees it? And yet he deserves
praise for his deceit, for with good judgment and art his master
hand often adds grace and beauty to ivory or silver, or to a beautiful
stone by encircling it with fine gold. Therefore let us not say
that art,—or such deceit as this, if you will call it so,—deserves
any censure.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nor is it unseemly for a man who is conscious of doing
something well, dexterously to seek occasion for showing himself
therein, and at the same time to conceal what he thinks
undeserving of praise,—but always with a touch of wary dissimulation.
Do you not remember that without appearing to
seek them, King Ferdinand<a href='#f32' class='c016'><sup>[32]</sup></a> found opportunities now and then
to go about in his doublet? and this because he felt himself to
be very agile; and that, as his hands were not over good, he
rarely or almost never took off his gloves? And there were
very few that perceived his cunning. Moreover I think I have
read that Julius Cæsar liked to wear the laurel wreath to hide
his baldness.<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c016'><sup>[184]</sup></a> But in all these matters it is needful to be very
cautious and to use good judgment, in order not to go beyond
bounds; for in avoiding one errour a man often runs into
another, and in his wish to win praise, receives censure.</p>

<p class='c001'>41.—“Hence in our mode of life and conversation, it is a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>safe thing to govern ourselves with a certain decorous discretion,
which in truth is a very great and very strong shield
against envy, which we ought to avoid as much as possible.
Moreover I wish our Courtier to guard against getting the name
of a liar or a boaster, which sometimes befalls even those who
do not deserve it. Therefore in his talk let him always take
care not to go beyond the probable, and also not to tell too often
those truths that have the look of falsehood,<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c016'><sup>[185]</sup></a>—like many who
never speak save of miracles, and wish to carry such authority
that every incredible thing shall be believed from them. Others,
at the beginning of a friendship and in order to gain favour with
their new friend, swear the first day they speak with him that
there is no one in the world whom they love more than him, and
that they would gladly die to do him service, and like things beyond
reason. And when they part from him, they pretend to
weep and to be unable to speak a word from grief. Thus, in
their wish to be thought very loving, they come to be esteemed
liars and silly flatterers.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But it would be too long and tedious to recount all the faults
that may be committed in our manner of conversation. Hence
as regards what I desire in the Courtier, let it suffice to say, besides
the things already said, that he should be of such sort as
never to be without something to say that is good and well
suited to those with whom he is speaking, and that he should
know how to refresh the minds of his hearers with a certain
sweetness, and by his amusing witticisms and pleasantries to
move them cleverly to mirth and laughter, so that without ever
becoming tedious or producing satiety, he may give pleasure
continually.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec2.42'></a>42.—“At last I think my lady Emilia will give me leave to be
silent. And if she refuse me, I shall by my own talk stand convicted
of not being the good Courtier whereof I have spoken for
not only does good talk (which perhaps you have neither now
nor ever heard from me), but even such talk as I usually have at
command (whatever that may be worth), quite fail me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lord Prefect said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am not willing to let this false opinion,—that you are not a
most admirable Courtier,—rest in the mind of any of us; for it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>certain that your desire to be silent proceeds rather from a wish
to escape labour than from lack of something to say. So, to the
end that nothing may seem to be neglected in such worthy company
as this and such admirable talk, be pleased to teach us how
we must employ the pleasantries that you have just mentioned,
and to show us the art that pertains to all this kind of amusing
talk, so as to excite laughter and mirth in gentle fashion;
for indeed methinks it is very important and well befitting the
Courtier.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lord,” replied messer Federico, “pleasantries and witticisms
are the gift and grace of nature rather than of art; but in
this matter certain nations are to be found more ready than
others, like the Tuscans, who in truth are very clever. It
seems to me that the use of witticism is very natural to the
Spaniards too. Yet there are many, both of these and of all other
nations, who from over loquacity sometimes go beyond bounds
and become silly and pointless, because they do not consider the
kind of person with whom they are speaking, the place where
they are, the occasion, or the soberness and modesty which they
ought above all things to maintain.”</p>

<p class='c001'>43.—Then my lord Prefect replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You deny that there is any art in pleasantries, and yet by
speaking ill of those who use them not with modesty and soberness
and who regard not the occasion and the persons with whom
they are speaking, methinks you show that even this can be
taught and has some method in it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“These rules, my Lord,” replied messer Federico, “are so
universal that they fit and apply to everything. But I said
there is no art in pleasantries, because I think there are only
two kinds of them to be found: one of which stretches out in
long and continuous talk, as we see in the case of certain men
who narrate and describe so gracefully and amusingly something
that has happened to them or that they have seen or
heard, that they set it before our eyes with gestures and words
and almost make us touch it with the hand; and for lack of
other word, we may perhaps call this the humourous or urbane
manner. The other kind of witticism is very short, and consists
solely in sayings that are quick and sharp, such as are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>often heard among us, or biting; nor are they acceptable unless
they sting a little. By the ancients also they were called apothegms:
at present some call them <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>arguzie</i></span>.<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c016'><sup>[186]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“So I say that in the first kind, which is humourous narrative,
there is no need of any art, because nature herself creates and
fashions men fitted to narrate amusingly, and gives them features,
gestures, voice and words proper to imitate what they
will. In the other kind, that of <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>arguzie</i></span>, what can art avail?
For whatever it be, a pungent saying must dart forth and hit the
mark before he who utters it shall seem to have given it a
thought; otherwise it is flat and has no savour. Therefore I
think it is all the work of intellect and nature.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Pietro Bembo took up the talk, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My lord Prefect does not deny what you say, that nature
and intellect play the chief part, especially as regards conception.
Still it is certain that every man’s mind, however fine his
intellect may be, conceives both good things and bad, and more
or less; yet judgment and art then polish and correct them, and
cull out the good and reject the bad. So lay aside what pertains
to intellect, and explain to us what consists in art; that is,
of the pleasantries and witticisms that excite laughter, tell us
what are befitting the Courtier and what are not, and in what
time and way they should be used; for this is what my lord
Prefect asks of you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>44.—Then messer Federico said laughingly:</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is no one of us here to whom I do not yield in everything,
and especially in being jocular; unless perhaps nonsense,
which often makes others laugh more than bright sayings, be
also counted as pleasantry.” And then turning to Count Ludovico
and to messer Bernardo Bibbiena, he said: “Here are the
masters of witticism, from whom I must first learn what to say
if I am to speak of jocose sayings.”<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c016'><sup>[187]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Count Ludovico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Methinks you are already beginning to practise what you
say you know nothing of, I mean in that you try to make these
gentlemen laugh by ridiculing messer Bernardo and me; for
every one of them knows you far excel us in that for which you
praise us. If you are fatigued, then, you had better beg my lady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Duchess to postpone the rest of our talk until to-morrow, instead
of trying to escape fatigue by subterfuge.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Federico began to make answer, but my lady Emilia
quickly interrupted him and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is not in order for the discussion to spend itself in your
praises; it is enough that you are all well known. But as I
remember, Sir Count, that you accused me last evening of not
distributing the labour equally, it were well to let messer Federico
rest awhile, and to give messer Bernardo Bibbiena the
task of speaking about pleasantries, because we not only know
him to be very amusing in continuous talk, but we remember
that he has several times promised us to try to write upon this
subject, and hence we may believe that he has already thought
much about it, and therefore ought to satisfy us fully. Afterwards,
when we have finished discussing pleasantries, messer
Federico shall go on with what he has left to say about the
Courtier.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thereupon messer Federico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lady, I do not know what I have left to say; but like
the wayfarer at noon, weary with the fatigue of his long journey,
I will refresh myself with messer Bernardo’s talk and the
sound of his words, as if under some delightful and shady tree,
with the soft murmur of a plashing spring. Then perhaps, being
revived a little, I shall be able to say something more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Bernardo replied, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“If I show you my head, you shall see what shade is to be
expected from the leafage of my tree.<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c016'><sup>[188]</sup></a> As for listening to the
murmur of that plashing spring, perhaps you may; for I was
once turned into a spring, not by any of the ancient gods but by
our friend Fra Mariano,<a href='#f60' class='c016'><sup>[60]</sup></a> and I have never stood in need of
water from then till now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then everyone began to laugh, for this pleasantry referred to
by messer Bernardo happened at Rome in the presence of Cardinal
Galeotto of San Pietro ad Vincula,<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c016'><sup>[189]</sup></a> and was well known
to all.</p>

<p class='c001'>45.—The laughter having ceased, my lady Emilia said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now stop making us laugh by your use of pleasantries, and
teach us how we are to use them, and from what they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>derived, and all you know about the subject. And to lose no
more time, begin at once.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>“I fear,” said messer Bernardo, “that the hour is late; and to
the end that my talk about pleasantries may not itself lack
pleasantry and be tedious, perhaps it will be well to postpone it
until to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here many replied together that it was still far from the
usual hour for ending the discussion. Then, turning to my lady
Duchess and to my lady Emilia, messer Bernardo said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not wish to escape this task; although, just as I am wont
to marvel at the presumption of those who venture to sing to the
viol before our friend Giacomo Sansecondo,<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c016'><sup>[190]</sup></a> so I ought not to
talk about pleasantries before an audience who understand
what I should say far better than I.</p>

<p class='c001'>“However, not to give any of these gentlemen a pretext for
refusing the charge that may be laid upon them, I will tell as
briefly as I can what occurs to me concerning the causes that
excite laughter; which is so peculiar to us that in defining man
we are wont to say that he is a laughing animal. For laughter
is found only among men, and is nearly always the sign of a
certain hilarity felt inwardly in the mind, which is by nature
drawn towards amusement and longs for repose and recreation;
wherefore we see many things devised by men to this end, such
as festivals and different kinds of shows. And since we love
those who furnish us this recreation, it was the custom of ancient
rulers (Roman, Athenian and many others), in order to
gain the people’s good will and to feast the eyes and minds of
the multitude, to erect great theatres and other public edifices,
and therein to exhibit new sports, horse and chariot races, combats,
strange beasts, comedies, tragedies and mimes. Nor were
such shows eschewed by grave philosophers, who in sports of
this kind and banquets often relaxed their minds when fatigued
by lofty discourse and spiritual meditation; which thing all kinds
of men also like to do: for not only toilers in the field, sailors,
and all those who perform hard and rough labour with their
hands, but holy priests, and prisoners awaiting death from hour
to hour, all seek continually some remedy and solace for their
refreshment. Hence everything that moves to laughter, cheers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>the mind and gives pleasure, and for the moment frees us from
the memory of those weary troubles of which our life is full. So
laughter, as you see, is very delightful to all, and greatly to be
praised is he who excites it reasonably and in a graceful way.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But what laughter is, and where it abides, and how it sometimes
seizes upon our veins, eyes, mouths and sides, and seems as
if it would make us burst, so that with all our effort it cannot be
restrained,—I will leave Democritus to tell, who could not even
if he were to promise.<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c016'><sup>[191]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>46.—“Now the occasion and as it were the source from which
the laughable springs, lies in a kind of distortion; for we laugh
only at those things that have incongruity in them and that
seem amiss without being so. I know not how to explain it
otherwise; but if you think of it yourselves, you will see that
what we laugh at is nearly always something that is incongruous
and yet is not amiss.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Next I will try to tell you, as far as my judgment shall show
me, what the means are that the Courtier ought to use for
the purpose of exciting laughter, and within what bounds;
because it is not seemly for the Courtier to be always making
men laugh, nor yet by those means that are made use of
by fools or drunken men, by the silly, the nonsensical, and
likewise by buffoons. And although these kinds of men seem
to be in demand at courts, yet they deserve not to be called
Courtiers, but each by his own name, and to be held for what
they are.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Moreover we must diligently consider the bounds and limits
of exciting laughter by derision, and who it is we deride; for
laughter is not aroused by jeering at a poor unfortunate nor yet
at an open rascal and blackguard, because the latter seems to
merit greater punishment than that of being ridiculed, and the
mind of man is not prone to flout the wretched, unless they boast
of their wretchedness and are proud and saucy. We ought also
to treat with respect those who are universal favourites and beloved
by all and powerful, for by jeering at these persons a man
may sometimes bring dangerous enmities upon himself. Yet it
is proper to flout and laugh at the vices of those who are neither
so wretched as to excite pity, nor so wicked as to seem worthy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>of capital punishment, nor so great that a touch of their wrath
can do much harm.</p>

<p class='c001'>47.—“Again, you must know that from the same occasion
whence we draw our laughable witticisms, we may likewise
draw serious phrases of praise or censure, and sometimes by
using the same words. Thus in praising a generous man who
shares all he has with his friends, we are wont to say that what
he has is not his own; the same may be said in censuring a man
who has stolen or by other evil means acquired what he possesses.
Also we say, ‘That lady is of great price,’ meaning to
praise her for discretion and goodness; the same thing might be
said in dispraise of her, implying that anyone may have her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But for this purpose we have a chance to use the same
situations oftener than the same words. Thus recently a lady
being at mass in church with three cavaliers, one of whom
served her in love,<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c016'><sup>[192]</sup></a> a poor beggar came up and taking his stand
before the lady began to beg alms of her; and he repeated his
petition several times to her with much importunity and pitiful
groaning; yet for all that she gave him no alms, nor still did she
refuse it to him with a sign to go in peace, but continued to
stand abstracted as if she were thinking of something else.
Then the cavalier in love said to his two companions:</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘You see what I have to expect from my lady, who is so hard-hearted
that she not only gives no alms to that naked starving
wretch who is begging it of her so eagerly and often, but she
will not even send him away. So much does she delight to see
a man languishing in misery before her and vainly imploring her
pity.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“One of his two friends replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘This is not hardness of heart, but a silent lesson from the
lady to teach you that she is never pleased with an importunate
suitor.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“The other replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘Nay, it is a warning to him that while she never grants
what is asked of her, still she likes to be entreated for it.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“You see how the lady’s failure to send the poor man away,
gave rise to one saying of grave censure, one of moderate
praise, and another of biting satire.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>48.—“Proceeding now to declare the kinds of pleasantries
that are pertinent to our subject, I say that in my opinion
there are three varieties, although messer Federico mentioned
only two: namely, that which consists in rendering the effect
of a thing by means of urbane and amusing long narrative, and
that which consists in the swift and keen readiness of a single
phrase. But we will add a third sort called practical joking,
in which long narratives and short sayings have place, and also
some action.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now the first, which consists in continuous talk, is of such
sort as almost to amount to story-telling. And to give you an
instance: just at the time when Pope Alexander the Sixth died
and Pius the Third was created pope,<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c016'><sup>[193]</sup></a> your fellow Mantuan,
my lady Duchess, messer Antonio Agnello,<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c016'><sup>[194]</sup></a> being at Rome and
in the palace, happened to speak of the death of the one pope
and of the other’s creation, and in discussing this with some of
his friends, he said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘My Lords, even in the days of Catullus<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c016'><sup>[195]</sup></a> doors began to
speak without a tongue and to listen without ears, and thus to
reveal adulteries. Now, although men are not of such worth as
they were in those times, it may be that the doors (many of
which are made of antique marbles, at least here in Rome) have
the same powers that they then had; and for my part I believe
that these two here could clear away all our doubts if we cared
to learn from them.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then the gentlemen present were very curious, and waited
to see how the affair was going to end. Whereupon messer
Antonio, continuing to walk up and down, raised his eyes as if
by chance to one of the two doors of the hall in which they were
strolling, stopped a moment, and pointed out to his companions
the inscription over it, which was the name of Pope Alexander,
followed by a V and an I, signifying Sixth as you know; and he
said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘See what the door says: <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Alessandro Papa vi</i></span>, which means
that he became pope by the violence that he used, and that he
accomplished more by violence than by reason. Now let us see
if from the other we can learn anything about the new pope.’
And turning to the other door as if by accident, he showed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>inscription, N PP V, which signified <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Nicolaus Papa Quintus</i></span>;<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c016'><sup>[196]</sup></a>
and he at once said: ‘Alas, bad news; this one says, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Nihil Papa
Valet</i></span>.’</p>

<p class='c001'>49.—“Now you see how elegant and admirable this kind of
pleasantry is, and how becoming to a Courtier, whether the thing
that is said be true or not; because in such a case it is allowable
for a man to fabricate as much as he pleases, without
blame; and in speaking the truth, to adorn it with a little falsity,
overstating or understating as the occasion requires. But in
these matters perfect grace and true cleverness consist in picturing
forth what we wish to say, with both word and gesture, so
well and with such ease that they who hear may seem to see
before their eyes the thing we tell them. And this graphic
method is so effective that it sometimes adorns and makes highly
amusing a thing that in itself is neither very jocular nor clever.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And although this kind of narrative requires gesture and the
aid of the speaking voice, its quality is sometimes found in written
compositions also. Who does not laugh, when, in the Eighth
Day of his Decameron,<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c016'><sup>[197]</sup></a> Giovanni Boccaccio tells how the priest
of Varlungo tried to chant a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Kyrie</i></span> and a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Sanctus</i></span> on discovering
that his Belcolore was in the church. There are amusing narratives
also in his stories of Calandrino,<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c016'><sup>[198]</sup></a> and in many others.
Of the same sort seems to be the raising of a laugh by mimicry
or imitation, as we say,—wherein I have thus far seen no one
more admirable than our friend messer Roberto da Bari.”<a href='#f48' class='c016'><sup>[48]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>50.—“This would be no small praise,” said messer Roberto, “if
it were true; because I should of course try to imitate the good
rather than the bad, and if I could make myself like some men I
know, I should deem myself very fortunate. I fear, however, that
I know how to imitate only those things which excite laughter,
and which you just now said consist essentially in the imperfect.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Bernardo replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Imperfect, yes; but not unpleasantly so. And you must
know that this imitation of which we are speaking, cannot be
without cleverness; for besides the way of governing words and
gestures and setting before our hearers’ eyes the face and manners
of the man we are speaking of, we must needs be discreet,
and pay great heed to the place and time, and to the persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>with whom we are speaking, and not descend to buffoonery or
go beyond bounds;—which rules you observe admirably and
therefore know them all, I think. For in truth it would little
befit a gentleman to make faces, to weep and laugh, and mimic
voices, to wrestle with himself as Berto<a href='#f65' class='c016'><sup>[65]</sup></a> does, or dress like a
clown before everyone, like Strascino,<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c016'><sup>[199]</sup></a>—and things of that kind,
which are very fitting in those men because it is their profession.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But for us it is needful to give only a fleeting and covert imitation,
always preserving the dignity of a gentleman, without
uttering foul words or performing acts that are less than seemly,
without contorting the face or person beyond measure; but to
order our movements in such fashion that whoever hears and
sees us may from our words and gestures imagine far more than
what he sees and hears, and so be moved to laughter.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Moreover in our imitation we ought to avoid too stinging
jibes, especially at deformities of face or person; for while
bodily defects often furnish excellent material for laughter to a
man who uses them with discretion, yet to employ this method
too bitterly is the act not only of a buffoon but of an enemy. So,
although it be difficult, in this regard we must, as I have said,
keep to the manner of our friend messer Roberto, who mimics
all men and not without marking their defects sharply even to
their face, and yet no one is annoyed or seems to take it amiss.
And I will give no instance of this, because in him we see countless
examples of it every day.</p>

<p class='c001'>51.—“Another thing excites much laughter, although it is included
under the head of narration; and that is to describe
gracefully certain defects of others,—unimportant ones however
and undeserving greater punishment, such as follies, sometimes
mere absurdities or sometimes accompanied by a quick and
pungent dash of liveliness; likewise certain extreme affectations;
sometimes a huge and well-constructed lie. As when, a few days
since, our friend Cesare told of a delightful absurdity, which was
that finding himself before the Podestà of this place,<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c016'><sup>[200]</sup></a> he saw a
peasant come in to complain of being robbed of a donkey. The
fellow told of his poverty and of the trick played upon him by
the thief, and then, to make out his loss the heavier, he said:
‘Masters, if you had seen my donkey, you would have better understood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>how much cause I have to grieve; for when he had his
pack on, he looked like a very Tullius.’<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c016'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c004'>Reduced from a photograph, specially made by Mansell, of an anonymous bas-relief in
the South Kensington Museum,—possibly the work of Sperandio di Bartolommeo de’
Savelli (1425?-1500?).</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>“And one of our friends, meeting a flock of goats with a great
he-goat at their head, stopped and said with a look of admiration:
‘See what a he-goat! He looks like a Saint Paul.’<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c016'><sup>[202]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“My lord Gaspar tells of having known an old servant of
Duke Ercole of Ferrara,<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c016'><sup>[203]</sup></a> who offered the duke his two sons
as pages; but before they could begin their service, both the
boys died. When the duke heard this, he condoled with the
father kindly, saying that he was very sorry, for the only time
when he had seen them, they had seemed to him very pretty
and gentle boys. The father replied: ‘My Lord, you saw nothing;
for within the last few days they had grown far handsomer
and more virtuous than I could possibly have believed,
and already they sang together like two sparrow-hawks.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“And not long since one of our doctors stood looking at a
man who had been condemned to be flogged about the piazza,
and taking pity on him, because (although his shoulders were
bleeding freely) the poor wretch walked as slowly as if he had
been out for a stroll to pass the time, the doctor said to him:
‘Step out, poor fellow, and make haste to be done with your
pain.’ Whereat the goodman turned, and gazing at the doctor
as if amazed, he stood awhile without speaking, and then said:
‘When you come to be flogged, you will go your own gait; so I
choose to go mine now.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“You surely must still remember that absurd story which my
lord Duke<a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a> lately told of a certain abbot, who, being present one
day when Duke Federico<a href='#f26' class='c016'><sup>[26]</sup></a> was discussing what to do with the
great mass of earth that had been excavated to lay the foundations
of this palace, which was then building, said: ‘My Lord, I
have thought of an excellent place to put it. Give orders to have
an immense pit made, and it can be put in without further difficulty.’
Duke Federico replied, not without laughter: ‘And
where shall we put the earth to be dug out of this pit of
yours?’ The abbot continued: ‘Have it made large enough to
hold both.’ And so, for all the duke repeated several times that
the larger the pit was made, the more earth would be dug out
of it, the man could never get it into his brain that it could not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>made large enough to hold both, and kept replying: ‘Make it so
much the larger.’ Now you see what good judgment this abbot
had.”</p>

<p class='c001'>52.—Then messer Pietro Bembo said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“And why do you not tell the story of your friend the Florentine
commander who was besieged in Castellina<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c016'><sup>[204]</sup></a> by the Duke
of Calabria? Finding one day some poisoned crossbow missiles
that had been shot in from the camp, he wrote to the duke that
if the warfare was to be carried on so barbarously, he too would
have medicine put on his cannon shot, and then woe to the one
who had the worst of it.”<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c016'><sup>[205]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Bernardo laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Messer Pietro, if you do not hold your peace, I will tell
all the things I have seen and heard about your dear Venetians
(which are not few), and especially when they try to play
the horseman.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not so, I beg of you,” replied messer Pietro, “and I
will keep quiet about two other delightful tales that I know of
the Florentines.”<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c016'><sup>[206]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Bernardo said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“They must have rather been Sienese, who often slip in this
way; as was recently the case with one, who, on hearing some
letters read in council wherein the phrase ‘the aforesaid’ was
used (to avoid such frequent repetition of the name of the man
who was spoken of), said to the man who was reading: ‘Stop
there a moment and tell me, is this Aforesaid a friend to our
commune?’”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Pietro laughed, then said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am speaking of Florentines, not of Sienese.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Speak out freely then,” added my lady Emilia, “and do not
stand so much on ceremony.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Pietro continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“When the Florentine Signory was waging war against the
Pisans,<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c016'><sup>[207]</sup></a> they sometimes found their money exhausted by their
great expenses; and the method of finding money for daily
needs being discussed in council one day, after many ways had
been proposed, one of the oldest citizens said: ‘I have thought
of two methods whereby we could soon get a goodly sum of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>money without much trouble. And one of these is, that since
we have no revenue greater than from the customs levied at the
gates of Florence, and since we have eleven gates, let us at once
have eleven more made, and thus we shall double our revenue.
The other method is to give orders that the mints be forthwith
opened in Pistoia and Prato,<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c016'><sup>[208]</sup></a> just the same as in Florence, and
that nothing be done there day and night but mint money, and
that all the money be ducats of gold; and in my judgment this
course is the quicker and the less costly.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>53.—There was much laughter at this citizen’s keen sagacity:
and the laughter being quieted, my lady Emilia said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Messer Bernardo, will you allow messer Pietro to ridicule
the Florentines in this fashion, without returning blow for
blow?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I forgive him this affront,” replied messer Bernardo, still
laughing, “for if he has displeased me by ridiculing the Florentines,
he has pleased me by obeying you, as I also would always
do.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Cesare said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I heard a delightful blunder made by a Brescian who had
been at Venice this year for the feast of the Ascension, and in
my presence was describing to some of his companions the fine
things that he had seen there; and how much merchandise there
was, and how much silverware, spices, cloth and stuffs; then the
Signory went forth with great pomp to wed the sea in the Bucentaur,<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c016'><sup>[209]</sup></a>
on board of which there were so many finely dressed gentlemen,
so much music and singing, that it seemed a paradise. And
on being asked by one of his companions which kind of music he
liked best among those that he had heard, he said: ‘They all were
good; but among the rest I saw a man playing on a certain strange
trumpet, which he thrust down his throat more than two palms
at every flourish, and then he straightway drew it out and thrust
it down again; so that you never saw a greater marvel.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then everyone laughed, perceiving the silly mistake of the
man, who had imagined that the player thrust down his throat
that part of the trombone which disappears by sliding into itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>54.—Messer Bernardo then continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Moreover common affectations are tedious, but they excite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>much laughter when they are beyond measure: like those we
sometimes hear from certain mouths regarding greatness or
courage or nobility; or sometimes from women, regarding
beauty or fastidiousness. As was not long since the case with a
lady who remained sad and abstracted at some great festival;
and when asked what she was thinking about that should make
her so gloomy, she replied: ‘I was thinking of a matter that
troubles me greatly whenever it occurs to me, nor can I lift it
from my heart; and this is, that on the universal Judgment Day,
when all men’s naked bodies must rise and appear before the
tribunal of Christ, I cannot endure the distress I feel at the
thought that my body will have to be seen unclothed among the
rest.’ Being extravagant, such affectations as these cause
laughter rather than tedium.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You all are familiar with those splendid lies so well composed
that they move to laughter. A very excellent one was
but lately told me by a friend of ours who never suffers us to be
without them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>55.—Then the Magnifico Giuliano said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Be that as it may, it cannot be more excellent or more ingenious
than one which a fellow-Tuscan of ours, a merchant of
Lucca, affirmed the other day as a positive fact.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tell it to us,” added my lady Duchess.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico Giuliano replied, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“This merchant, so he tells the story, once finding himself in
Poland, decided to buy a quantity of sables with the intention of
carrying them into Italy and making great profit thereby. And
after much effort, being unable to enter Muscovy himself (by
reason of the war that was then waging between the King of
Poland and the Duke of Muscovy), he arranged with the help of
some people of the country, that on an appointed day certain
Muscovite merchants should come with their sables to the frontier
of Poland, and he promised to be there in order to strike the
bargain. Accordingly, proceeding with his companions towards
Muscovy, the man of Lucca reached the Dnieper, which he
found all frozen as hard as marble, and saw that the Muscovites
(who on account of the war were themselves suspicious of the
Poles) were already on the other bank, but approached no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>nearer than the width of the river. So, having recognized each
other, the Muscovites after some signalling began to speak with
a loud voice, and to ask the price that they wished for their
sables; but such was the extreme cold that they were not heard,
for before reaching the other bank (where the man of Lucca
and his interpreters were) the words froze in the air, and remained
there frozen and caught in such manner that the Poles,
who knew the custom, set about making a great fire in the very
middle of the river; because to their thinking that was the limit
reached by the warm voice before it was stopped by freezing,
and the river was quite solid enough to bear the fire easily. So,
when this was done, the words (which had remained frozen for
the space of an hour) in due course began to melt and to fall in
a murmur, like snow from the mountains in May; and thus they
were at once heard very well, although the men had already
gone. But as the merchant thought that the words asked too
high a price for the sables, he would not accept the offer and so
returned without them.”<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c016'><sup>[210]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>56.—Thereupon everyone laughed, and messer Bernardo said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of a truth the story I wish to tell you is not so ingenious;
however it is a fine one, and runs as follows:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Speaking a few days since of the country or World recently
discovered by the Portuguese mariners,<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c016'><sup>[211]</sup></a> and of the various animals
and other things which they bring back to Portugal, that
friend of whom I told you affirmed that he had seen a monkey
of a form very different from those we are accustomed to see,
which played chess most admirably. And among other occasions,
the gentleman who had brought her, being one day before
the King of Portugal<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c016'><sup>[212]</sup></a> and engaged in a game of chess with
her, the monkey made several moves so skilfully as to press him
hard and at last checkmated him. Being vexed, as all are wont
to be who lose at that game, the gentleman took up the king-piece
(which was very large, such as the Portuguese use) and
gave the monkey a smart blow upon the head; whereupon she
leaped aside crying loudly, and seemed to ask justice of the king
for the wrong that had been done her. Then the gentleman invited
her to play again; and after refusing awhile by means of signs,
she finally began to play once more, and, as she had done the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>first time, she again had the better of him. At last, seeing that
she would be able to checkmate the gentleman, the monkey
tried a new trick to guard against being struck again; and without
showing what she was at, she quietly put her right paw
under the gentleman’s left elbow, which was luxuriously resting
on a taffety<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c016'><sup>[213]</sup></a> cushion, and (quickly snatching the cushion) with
her left paw she at the same time checkmated him with a pawn,
while with her right she held the cushion over her head as a
shield against his blows; she then leaped joyfully to the king as
if to parade her victory. Now you see how wise, wary and discreet
the monkey was.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Cesare Gonzaga said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It must be that this was a doctor among monkeys, and of
great authority; and I think that the Republic of Indian Monkeys
sent her to Portugal to make a name in a foreign land.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thereupon everyone laughed, both at the story and at the addition
given to it by messer Cesare.</p>

<p class='c001'>57.—So, continuing the discussion, messer Bernardo said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have now heard what occurs to me concerning those
pleasantries that render the effect of a thing by continuous talk;
therefore it is now well to speak of those that consist in a single
saying and have a quick keenness compressed into a phrase or
word. And just as in the first kind,—that of humourous talk,—we
must in our narrative and mimicry avoid resembling buffoons
and parasites and those who make others laugh by their sheer
absurdities, so in these short sayings the Courtier must take care
not to appear malicious and spiteful, and not to utter witticisms
and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>arguzie</i></span> solely to annoy and cut to the quick; because for the
sin of their tongue such men often suffer in all their members.</p>

<p class='c001'>58.—“Now of the ready pleasantries that are contained in a
short saying, those are keenest that arise from ambiguity. Yet
they do not always move to laughter, for they are oftener applauded
as ingenious than as comic. As was said a few days
since by our friend messer Annibal Paleotto<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c016'><sup>[214]</sup></a> to someone who
was recommending a tutor to teach his sons grammar, and who,
after praising the tutor as very learned, said that by way of stipend
the man desired not only money but a room furnished for
living and sleeping, because he had no <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>letto</i></span> (bed): whereupon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>messer Annibal at once replied: ‘And how can he be learned if
he has not <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>letto</i></span> (read)?’ You see how well he played upon the
double meaning of the phrase, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>non aver letto</i></span> [to have no bed, or,
not to have read].</p>

<p class='c001'>“But while this punning witticism has much sharpness,
where a man takes words in a sense different from that in which
everyone else takes them, it seems (as I have said) to excite
wonderment rather than laughter, except when it is combined
with some other kind of saying.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now that kind of witticism which is most used to excite
laughter, is when we are prepared to hear one thing and the
speaker says another, and it is called ‘the unexpected.’ And
if punning be combined with this, the witticism becomes most
spicy: as the other day, when there was a discussion about making
a fine brick floor (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>un bel mattonato</i></span>) for my lady Duchess’s
closet, after much talk you, Giancristoforo, said: ‘If we could
fetch the Bishop of Potenza<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c016'><sup>[215]</sup></a> and flatten him out well, it would
be the very thing, for he is the craziest creature born (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>il più bel
matto nato</i></span>).’ Everyone laughed heartily, for by dividing the
word <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>matto-nato</i></span> you made the pun. Moreover saying that
it would be well to flatten out a bishop and lay him in the floor
of a room, was unexpected to the listener; and so the sally was
very keen and laughable.</p>

<p class='c001'>59.—“But of punning witticisms there are many kinds;
therefore we must be careful and play very lightly with our
words, and avoid those that make the sally flat or that seem
forced; and also those (as we have said) that are too biting.
As where several companions found themselves at the house
of one of their friends who was blind of one eye, and the blind
man bade the company stay to dinner, all took their leave save
one, who said: ‘I will stay with you because I see you have a
vacant place for one;’ and at the same time he pointed with his
finger to the empty socket. You see this is too bitter and rude,
for it wounded without cause, and the speaker had not first been
stung himself. Moreover he said that which might be said of all
blind men; and such universal things give no pleasure, because
it seems possible that they may have been thought out beforehand.
And of this kind was that gibe at a man without nose:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>‘And where do you hang your spectacles?’<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c016'><sup>[216]</sup></a> or ‘With what do
you smell the roses in their season?’</p>

<p class='c001'>60.—“But among other witticisms those have very good grace
that are made by taking the very words and sense from another
man’s taunt and turning them against him and striking him with
his own weapons; as where a litigant—whose adversary had
said to him in the judge’s presence: ‘Why do you bark so?’—at
once replied: ‘Because I see a thief.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“And another instance of this was when Galeotto da Narni,<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c016'><sup>[217]</sup></a>
on his way through Siena, stopped in the street to ask for the
inn; and a Sienese, seeing how fat he was, said, laughing:
‘Other men carry their wallets behind, but this one carries his in
front.’ Galeotto at once replied: ‘That is the way we do in a
land of thieves.’</p>

<p class='c001'>61.—“There is still another kind, which we call playing on words,<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c016'><sup>[218]</sup></a>
and this consists in changing a word by either adding or omitting
a letter or a syllable; as when someone said: ‘You are better
versed in the Lat<em>r</em>in tongue than in the Greek.’ And you, my
Lady, had a letter addressed to you, ‘To my lady Emilia <em>Im</em>pia.’<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c016'><sup>[219]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Moreover it is a pleasant thing to quote a verse or two, applying
it to a purpose different from that which the author intends,
or some other familiar saw; sometimes to the same purpose, but
changing some word. As when a gentleman, who had an ugly
and disagreeable wife, was asked how he was, he replied: ‘Judge
yourself of my state, when <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Furiarum maxima juxta me cubat</i></span>.’<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c016'><sup>[220]</sup></a>
And messer Geronimo Donato,<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c016'><sup>[221]</sup></a> while going the rounds of the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Stazioni</i></span><a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c016'><sup>[222]</sup></a> at Rome in Lent with several other gentlemen, met a
bevy of beautiful Roman ladies; and one of the gentlemen saying:
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Quot coelum stellas, tot habet tua Roma puellas</i></span>,’<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c016'><sup>[223]</sup></a> he at once
replied: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Pascua quotque haedos, tot habet tua Roma cinaedos</i></span>,<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c016'><sup>[224]</sup></a>

other direction.</p>

charge of a friar reputed to be of very pure life and learned
as well, it came to pass that, as the friar frequented the convent
familiarly and often confessed the nuns, five of them (more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>half of all there were) became pregnant; and the affair being
discovered, the friar wished to flee but knew not how. The
bishop had him taken into custody, and he soon confessed that
he had brought the five nuns to this pass, being tempted of the
devil; wherefore the bishop was firmly resolved to punish him
roundly. But as the man was learned, he had many friends who
all tried to help him, and along with the rest messer Marcantonio
went to the bishop to implore some measure of pardon for him.
The bishop would in no wise listen to them; and after they had
pleaded hard, and recommended the culprit, and urged in excuse
the opportunities of his position, the frailty of human nature,
and many other things,—at last the bishop said: ‘I will
do nothing for him, because I shall have to render God an
account of the matter.’ And when they repeated their arguments,
the bishop said: ‘What answer shall I make to God on
the Day of Judgment, when he says to me, <em>Give an account of
thy stewardship</em>?’<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c016'><sup>[226]</sup></a> Then messer Marcantonio at once said:
‘My Lord, say that which the Evangelist says: <em>Lord, thou
deliveredst unto me five talents: behold I have gained besides them
five talents more</em>.’<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c016'><sup>[227]</sup></a> Whereupon the bishop could not keep
from laughing, and greatly softened his anger and the punishment
intended for the offender.</p>

<p class='c001'>62.—“It is also amusing to interpret names, and to pretend
some reason why the man who is spoken of bears such a name,
or why something is done. As a few days ago, when Proto da
Lucca<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c016'><sup>[228]</sup></a> (who is very amusing, as you know) asked for the
bishopric of Caglio, the Pope replied: ‘Knowest thou not that in
the Spanish tongue <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>caglio</i></span> means <em>I keep silence</em>? And thou art a
babbler; wherefore it would be unseemly for a bishop never to
be able to repeat his title without telling an untruth. So be
thou silent (<span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>caglia</i></span>) now.’ Here Proto made a reply, which,
although it was not of this sort, yet was not less to the point; for
having several times repeated his request, and seeing that it was
of no avail, at last he said: ‘Holy Father, if your Holiness grant
me this bishopric, it will not be without advantage, for I shall
leave your Holiness two offices (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>ufficii</i></span>).’ ‘And what offices
have you to leave?’ said the Pope. Proto replied: ‘The full
office (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>ufficio grande</i></span>), and the Madonna’s office (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>ufficio della
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Madonna</i></span>).’<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c016'><sup>[229]</sup></a> Then the Pope could not keep from laughing,
although he was a very grave man.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Still another man at Padua said that Calfurnio<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c016'><sup>[230]</sup></a> was so
named because he was accustomed to heat (<em>s</em>cal<em>dare</em>) ovens
(<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>forni</i></span>). And when I one day asked Fedra<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c016'><sup>[231]</sup></a> why it was that on
Good Friday, while the Church offered prayer not only for
Christians but even for pagans and Jews, no mention is made of
cardinals along with bishops and other prelates,—he answered
me that cardinals were included in that prayer which says: ‘Let
us pray for heretics and schismatics.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“And our friend Count Ludovico said that the reason why I
censured a lady for using a certain cosmetic that gave a high
polish, was because I saw myself in her face, when it was
painted, as in a mirrour; and being ill favoured I could have no
wish to see myself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of this kind was that retort of messer Camillo Paleotto<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c016'><sup>[232]</sup></a> to
messer Antonio Porcaro,<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c016'><sup>[233]</sup></a> who, in speaking of a companion
who told the priest at confession that he fasted zealously, attended
mass and the sacred offices, and did all the good in the
world, said: ‘The man praises himself instead of owning his
sins;’ to which messer Camillo replied: ‘Nay, he confesses
these things because he thinks it a great sin to do them.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you not remember what a good thing my lord Prefect
said the other day? When Giantommaso Galeotto<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c016'><sup>[234]</sup></a> was surprised
at a man’s asking two hundred ducats for a horse, because,
as Giantommaso said, it was not worth a farthing and
among other defects was so afraid of weapons that no one could
make it come near them,—my lord Prefect (wishing to twit the
man with cowardice) said: ‘If the horse has this trick of running
away from weapons, I wonder that he does not ask a thousand
ducats for it.’</p>

<p class='c001'>63.—“Moreover the very same word is sometimes employed,
but in a sense different from the usual one. As when my lord
Duke,<a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a> being about to cross a very rapid river, said to a trumpeter:
‘Cross over’ (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>passa</i></span>); and the trumpeter turned cap in
hand, and said respectfully: ‘After your Lordship’ (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>passi la Signoria
Vostra</i></span>).</p>

<p class='c001'>“Another amusing kind of banter is where a man takes the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>speaker’s words but not his sense. As was the case this year
when a German at Rome, meeting one evening with our friend
messer Filippo Beroaldo,<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c016'><sup>[235]</sup></a> whose pupil he was, said: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Domine

replied: <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Tibi malum cito</i></span>.<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c016'><sup>[237]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Again, Diego de Chignones<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c016'><sup>[238]</sup></a> being at the Great Captain’s<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c016'><sup>[239]</sup></a>
table, another Spaniard, who was eating with them, said: ‘<span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>Vino</i></span>,‘
meaning to ask for drink; Diego replied: ’<span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>Y no lo conocistes</i></span>,’<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c016'><sup>[240]</sup></a>
meaning to taunt the man with being a heretic.<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c016'><sup>[241]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Another time messer Giacomo Sadoleto<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c016'><sup>[242]</sup></a> asked Beroaldo,<a href='#f235' class='c016'><sup>[235]</sup></a>
who was saying how much he wished to go to Bologna: ‘What
is it that so presses you at this time to leave Rome, where there
are so many pleasures, to go to Bologna, which is full of turmoil?’
Beroaldo replied: ‘On three counts I am forced to go to
Bologna,’ and lifted three fingers of his left hand to enumerate
three reasons for his going; when messer Giacomo quickly interrupted
him and said: ‘These three Counts that make you go
to Bologna are: first, Count Ludovico da San Bonifacio; second,
Count Ercole Rangone; third, the Count of Pepoli.’ Whereupon
everyone laughed, because these three Counts had been
pupils of Beroaldo, and were fine youths studying at Bologna.<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c016'><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Now we laugh heartily at this kind of witticism, because it
carries with it a response different from the one we are expecting
to hear, and in such matters we are naturally amused by our
very mistake and laugh to find ourselves cheated of what we
expect.</p>

<p class='c001'>64.—“But the modes of speech and the figures that are graceful
in grave and serious talk, are nearly always becoming in
pleasantries and games as well. You see that words set in opposition
produce much grace, when one contrasting clause is
balanced by another. The same method is often very witty.
Thus a Genoese, who was very prodigal in spending, was reproached
by a very miserly usurer, who said to him: ‘When
will you ever cease throwing away your riches?’ And he replied:
‘When you cease stealing other men’s.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“And since, as we have said, the same situations that give opportunity
for biting pleasantries may also give opportunity for
serious words of praise,—it is a very graceful and becoming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>method in either case for a man to admit or confirm what another
speaker says, but to interpret it in a manner different from
what was intended. Thus a village priest was saying mass to
his flock not long since, and after he had announced the festivals
of the week, he began the general confession in the people’s
name, saying: ‘I have sinned by doing evil, by saying evil, by
thinking evil,’ and so forth, making mention of all the deadly
sins. Whereupon a friend and close familiar of the priest, in
order to make sport of him, said to the bystanders: ‘Bear witness
all of you to what by his own mouth he confesses he has
done, for I mean to report him to the bishop.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“This same method was used by Sallaza dalla Pedrada<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c016'><sup>[244]</sup></a> in
complimenting a lady with whom he was speaking. First he
praised her for her virtuous qualities and then for still being
beautiful; and she replying that she did not deserve such praise
because she was already old, he said to her: ‘My Lady, your
only sign of age is your resemblance to the angels, who were the
first and oldest creatures that God ever made.’</p>

<p class='c001'>65.—“Just as serious sayings are useful for praising, in like
fashion we find great utility also in jocose sayings for taunting,
and in well arranged metaphors, especially if they take the form
of repartee, and if he who replies preserves the same metaphor
used by his interlocutor. And of this kind was the answer made
to messer Palla degli Strozzi,<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c016'><sup>[245]</sup></a> who being exiled from Florence,
sent back a servant on a certain matter of business and said to
him rather threateningly: ‘Thou wilt tell Cosimo de’ Medici
from me that the hen is hatching.’<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c016'><sup>[246]</sup></a> The messenger did the
errand commanded him, and Cosimo at once replied without
hesitation: ‘And thou wilt tell messer Palla from me that hens
cannot hatch well away from their nests.’</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>“Again, with a metaphor messer Camillo Porcaro<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c016'><sup>[247]</sup></a> gracefully
praised my lord Marcantonio Colonna;<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c016'><sup>[248]</sup></a> who, having heard that
messer Camillo had been extolling in an oration certain Italian
gentlemen famous as warriors, and had spoken very highly of
him among the rest, he expressed his thanks and said: ‘Messer
Camillo, you have treated your friends as some merchants treat
their money when it is found to contain a false ducat; for in
order to be rid of it, they put the piece among many good ones,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>and in this way pass it on. So you, to do me honour (although I
am of little worth), have put me in company with such worthy
and excellent cavaliers, that by virtue of their merit I shall perhaps
pass as good.’ Then messer Camillo replied: ‘Those who
forge ducats are wont to gild them so well that they seem to the
eye much finer than the good ones; so, if there were forgers of
men as there are of ducats, we should have reason to suspect
that you were false, being as you are of far finer and brighter
metal than any of the rest.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“You see that this situation gave opportunity for both kinds
of witticism; and so do many others, of which countless instances
could be given and especially in serious sayings. Like
the one uttered by the Great Captain, who, being seated at
table and all the places being already taken, saw that there
remained standing two Italian cavaliers who had served very
gallantly in the war; and he at once rose himself and caused all
the others to rise and make room for these two, saying: ‘Allow
these cavaliers to sit at their meat, for had it not been for them,
the rest of us should now have no meat to eat.’ Another time he
said to Diego Garzia,<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c016'><sup>[249]</sup></a> who was urging him to retire from a
dangerous position where the cannon shot were falling: ‘Since
God hath put no fear in your heart, do not try to put any in
mine.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“And King Louis,<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c016'><sup>[250]</sup></a> who is to-day king of France, being told
soon after his accession that then was the time to punish his
enemies who had so grievously wronged him while he was Duke
of Orleans, replied that it was not seemly for the King of France
to avenge the wrongs of the Duke of Orleans.</p>

<p class='c001'>66.—“Taunts are also often humourously uttered with a grave
air and without exciting laughter. As when Djem Othman,<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c016'><sup>[251]</sup></a>
brother to the Grand Turk,<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c016'><sup>[252]</sup></a> being a captive at Rome, said that
jousting as we practise it in Italy seemed to him too great a
matter for play and too paltry for earnest. And on being told
how agile and active King Ferdinand the Younger was in running,
leaping, vaulting, and the like,—he said that in his country
slaves practised these exercises, while gentlemen studied the
liberal arts from boyhood, and prided themselves thereon.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Almost of the same kind, too, but somewhat more laughable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>was what the Archbishop of Florence said to the Alexandrian
cardinal:<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c016'><sup>[253]</sup></a> that men have only their goods, their body, and
their soul; their goods are put in peril by the lawyers, their
body by the physicians, and their soul by the theologians.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the Magnifico Giuliano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“To this you might add what Nicoletto<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c016'><sup>[254]</sup></a> said: that we seldom
find a lawyer who goes to law, a physician who takes physic, or
a theologian who is a good Christian.”</p>

<p class='c001'>67.—Messer Bernardo laughed, then went on:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of these there are countless instances, uttered by great lords
and very weighty men. But we often laugh at similes also, such
as the one that our friend Pistoia<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c016'><sup>[255]</sup></a> wrote to Serafino: ‘Send
back the wallet that looks like you;’ because, if you remember
rightly, Serafino looked very like a wallet.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Moreover there are some who delight to liken men and women
to horses, dogs, birds, and often to chests, stools, carts, candle-sticks;
which is sometimes good and sometimes very flat.
Therefore in this it is needful to consider time, place, persons,
and the other things that we have mentioned so many times.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lord Gaspar Pallavicino said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“An amusing comparison was the one that our friend my lord
Giovanni Gonzaga<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c016'><sup>[256]</sup></a> made between Alexander the Great and
his own son Alessandro.”<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c016'><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not know it,” replied messer Bernardo.</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My lord Giovanni was playing with three dice, and as was
his wont had lost many ducats and was still losing; and his son
my lord Alessandro (who, although only a lad, is as fond of play
as the father is) stood looking at him with great attention and
seemed very sad. Count Pianella,<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c016'><sup>[258]</sup></a> who was present with many
other gentlemen, said: ‘You see, my Lord, that my lord Alessandro
is little pleased at your losing, and is waiting anxiously for
you to win so that he may have some of your winnings. Therefore
put him out of his misery, and before you lose everything
give him at least a ducat, in order that he too may go and play
with his fellows.’ Then my lord Giovanni said: ‘You are
wrong, for Alessandro is not thinking of any such trifle. But as
it is written that when he was a boy, Alexander the Great began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>to weep on hearing that his father Philip<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c016'><sup>[259]</sup></a> had won a great battle
and subdued some kingdom, and when he was asked why he
wept, he replied that it was because he feared his father would
subdue so many lands as to leave nothing for him to subdue; in
the same way my son Alessandro is now grieving and about to
weep, seeing that I his father am losing, because he fears I am
losing so much that I shall leave nothing for him to lose.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>68.—After some laughter at this, messer Bernardo continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Moreover we must avoid impiety in our witticism, (because
from this it is only a step to try to be jocular by blaspheming
and to invent new forms of blasphemy); otherwise we seem to
seek applause by that for which we deserve not only blame but
heavy punishment, which is an abominable thing. And therefore
those of us who like to show their pleasantry by little reverence
to God, deserve to be chased from the society of every
gentleman.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And they, no less, who are indecent and foul of speech, and
show no respect for ladies’ presence and seem to have no other
pleasure than to make them blush with shame, and who to that
end are continually seeking witticisms and <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>arguzie</i></span>. As in Ferrara
this year at a banquet attended by many ladies, there were
a Florentine and a Sienese, who are usually hostile, as you
know. To taunt the Florentine, the Sienese said: ‘We have
married Siena to the Emperor and have given him Florence
for dowry.’ He said this because it was reported at the time
that the Sienese had given the Emperor a certain sum of
money and that he had taken their city under his protection.
The Florentine quickly retorted: ‘Siena will first be possessed’
(he used the Italian word, but with the French meaning); ‘then
the dowry will be disputed at leisure.’<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c016'><sup>[260]</sup></a> You see that the retort
was clever, but, being made in the presence of ladies, it became
indecent and unseemly.”</p>

<p class='c001'>69.—Then my lord Gaspar Pallavicino said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Women delight to hear nothing else; and you would deprive
them of it. Moreover for my part I have found myself blushing
with shame at words uttered by women far oftener than by
men.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of such women I was not speaking,” said messer Bernardo;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>“but of virtuous ladies, who deserve reverence and honour from
every gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“We should have to invent a subtle rule by which to distinguish
them, for most often those who are seemingly the best, in
fact are quite the contrary.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Bernardo said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“If we had not present here my lord Magnifico, who is everywhere
accounted the champion of women, I should undertake to
answer you; but I am unwilling to do him wrong.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here my lady Emilia said, also laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Women have need of no champion against an accuser of
so little weight. So leave my lord Gaspar in his perverse opinion,—which
arises from his never having found a lady to look at
him, rather than from any fault on their part,—and go on with
your talk about pleasantries.”</p>

<p class='c001'>70.—Then messer Bernardo said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“In truth, my Lady, methinks I have told of many situations
from which we can derive sharp witticisms, which then have the
more grace the more they are accompanied by fine narrative.
Still many others might be mentioned. As when, by overstatement
or understatement, we say things that outrageously exceed
the probable; and of this sort was what Mario da Volterra<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c016'><sup>[261]</sup></a>
said of a prelate, that he held himself so great a man that when
he entered St. Peter’s, he stooped in order not to strike his head
against the architrave of the portal. Again, our friend here the
Magnifico said that his servant Galpino was so lean and light
that in blowing the fire to kindle it one morning, the fellow had
been carried by the smoke all the way up the chimney to the
very top; but happening to be brought crosswise against one of
the openings, he had the good luck not to be blown away with
the smoke.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Another time messer Agostino Bevazzano<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c016'><sup>[262]</sup></a> said that a miser,
who had been unwilling to sell his grain while it was dear, afterwards
hanged himself in despair from a rafter of his bedroom
when he found that the price had greatly fallen; and one of his
servants ran in on hearing the noise, saw the miser hanging, and
quickly cut the rope and thus rescued him from death. Then,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>having come to himself, the miser insisted that his servant should
pay him for the rope that had been cut.</p>

Raphael (1483-1520), probably painted in April 1516.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>“Of the same sort also seems to be what Lorenzo de’ Medici
said to a dull buffoon: ‘You would not make me laugh if you
tickled me.’ And in like fashion he answered another simpleton
who had found him abed very late one morning, and who had
reproved him for sleeping so late, saying: ‘I have already been
at the New Market and the Old, then outside the San Gallo gate
and around the walls for exercise, and have done a thousand
things besides; and you are still asleep?’ Then Lorenzo said:
‘What I dreamed in one hour is worth more than what you
accomplished in four.’</p>

<p class='c001'>71.—“It is also fine when in a retort we censure something
without apparently meaning to censure it. For instance, the

being at table with many gentlemen, one of them said after eating

so saying he began to gulp down the broth that remained. Then
the Marquess said quickly: ‘Ask pardon rather of the swine,
for you do me no wrong at all.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“Again, to censure a tyrant who was falsely reputed to be generous,
messer Niccolò Leonico<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c016'><sup>[264]</sup></a> said: ‘Think what generosity
rules him, for he gives away not his own things only, but other
men’s as well!’</p>

<p class='c001'>72.—“Another very pretty form of pleasantry is that which
consists in a kind of innuendo, when we say one thing and
tacitly imply another. Of course I do not mean another thing
of a completely different kind, like calling a dwarf gigantic and
a negro white or a very ugly man handsome, for the difference
is too obvious,—although even these sometimes cause laughter;
but I mean when with stern and serious air we humourously say
something in jest which is not our real thought. For instance,
when a gentleman told a palpable lie to messer Agostino Foglietta<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c016'><sup>[265]</sup></a>
and affirmed it stoutly on seeing that he had much difficulty
in believing it, messer Agostino said at last: ‘Fair sir, if I may
ever hope to receive kindness from you, do me the favour to be
content even if I do not believe anything you say.’ But as the
other repeated, and under oath, that it was the truth, he finally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>said: ‘Since you will have it so, I will believe it for your sake,
for indeed I would do even a greater thing than this for you.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don Giovanni di Cardona<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c016'><sup>[266]</sup></a> said something nearly of this sort
about a man who wished to leave Rome: ‘To my thinking the
fellow is ill advised, for he is so great a rascal that by staying on
at Rome he might in time become a cardinal.’ Of this sort also
is what was said by Alfonso Santacroce,<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c016'><sup>[267]</sup></a> who had shortly before
suffered some outrage from the Cardinal of Pavia.<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c016'><sup>[268]</sup></a> While
strolling with several gentlemen near the place of public execution
outside Bologna, he saw a man who had recently been
hanged, and turning towards the body with a thoughtful air, he
said loud enough for everyone to hear him: ‘Happy thou, who
hast naught to do with the Cardinal of Pavia.’</p>

<p class='c001'>73.—“And this sort of pleasantry which is tinged with irony
seems very becoming to great men, because it is dignified and
sharp, and can be used in jocose as well as in serious matters.
Hence many ancients (and those among the most esteemed)
have used it, like Cato and Scipio Africanus the Younger; but
above all men, the philosopher Socrates is said to have excelled
in it. And in our own times King Alfonso I of Aragon,<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c016'><sup>[269]</sup></a> who,
being about to eat one morning, took off the many precious
rings that he had on his fingers, in order not to wet them in
washing his hands, and so gave them to the first person he
happened on, almost without looking to see who it was. This
servant supposed that the king had taken no notice who received
them, and by reason of weightier cares would easily forget them
altogether; and in this he was the more confirmed, seeing that
the king did not ask for them again; and as he saw days, weeks
and months pass without hearing a word about them, he thought
he was surely safe. Accordingly, nearly a year after this had
happened, he presented himself again one morning as the king
was about to eat, and held out his hand to receive the rings;
whereupon the king bent close to his ear and said to him: ‘Let
the first ones suffice thee, because these will do for someone
else.’ You see how biting, clever and dignified the sally was,
and how truly worthy the exalted spirit of an Alexander.</p>

<p>OTTAVIANO UBALDINI<br />Died 1498</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Enlarged from Braun’s photograph (no. 19.553) of the painting, “Astronomy,” by
Melozzo degli Ambrosi da Forli (1438-1494). The picture, of which this head is a detail,
was one of a series of panels painted to decorate Duke Federico di Montefeltro’s
library in the palace of Urbino, but is now in the Royal Museum at Berlin. For iconographical
identification, see Schmarzow’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Melozzo da Forli, ein Beitrag zur Kunst-
und Kulturgeschichte Italiens im XV Jahrhundert</cite></span> (Berlin: 1886), p. 84.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>74.—“Similar to this manner (which savours of the ironical) is
another method, that of describing an evil thing in polite terms.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>As the Great Captain said to one of his cavaliers, who, after the
battle of Cerignola,<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c016'><sup>[270]</sup></a> when the danger was over, came forward
in the richest armour possible to describe, accoutered as if for
battle. And then the Great Captain turned to Don Ugo di Cardona<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c016'><sup>[271]</sup></a>
and said: ‘Have no more fear of storm, for Saint Elmo
has appeared;’ and with this polite speech he stung the man
to the quick, because you know that Saint Elmo<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c016'><sup>[272]</sup></a> always appears
to mariners after the tempest and gives token of fair weather;
and thus the Great Captain meant that this cavalier’s appearance
was a token that the danger was quite passed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Another time my lord Ottaviano Ubaldini,<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c016'><sup>[273]</sup></a> being at Florence
in the company of some citizens of great influence, and the
talk being about soldiers, one of them asked him if he knew
Antonello da Forli,<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c016'><sup>[274]</sup></a> who had at that time fled from Florentine
territory. My lord Ottaviano replied: ‘I do not know him, but
have always heard him spoken of as a prompt soldier.’ Whereupon
another Florentine said: ‘You see how prompt he is, when
he takes his departure without asking leave.’</p>

<p class='c001'>75.—“Those witticisms also are very clever in which we take
from our interlocutor’s lips something that he does not mean.
And of this kind, methinks, was my lord Duke’s reply to the
castellan who lost San Leo<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c016'><sup>[275]</sup></a> when this duchy was taken by
Pope Alexander and given to Duke Valentino;<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c016'><sup>[276]</sup></a> and it was
this: my lord Duke being in Venice at the time I have mentioned,
many of his subjects came continually to give him secret
news how things were faring in his state; and among the rest
came this castellan, who, after having excused himself as best he
could, ascribing the blame to mischance, said: ‘Have no anxiety,
my Lord, because I still have heart to take measures for the recovery
of San Leo.’ Then my lord Duke replied: ‘Trouble
yourself no more about the matter, for the mere loss of it was a
measure that rendered its recovery possible.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are certain other sayings when a man known to be
clever says something that seems to proceed from foolishness.
For instance, messer Camillo Paleotto<a href='#f232' class='c016'><sup>[232]</sup></a> said of someone the
other day: ‘He was such a fool that he died as soon as he began
to grow rich.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of like kind with this is a spicy and keen dissimulation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>where a man (discreet, as I have said) pretends not to understand
something that he does understand. Like what was said
by the Marquess Federico of Mantua, who,—being pestered by a
tiresome fellow who complained that some of his neighbours
were snaring doves out of his dovecote, and all the while held
one of them in his hand, hanging dead just as he had found it
with its foot caught in the snare,—replied that the matter should
be looked to. The fellow repeated the story of his loss not
once only but many times, always displaying the dove that had
been hanged, and saying: ‘And what, my Lord, do you think
ought to be done in this case?’ At last the Marquess said: ‘I think
the dove ought on no account to be buried in church, for having
hanged itself, it must be believed to have committed suicide.’<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c016'><sup>[277]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Somewhat of the same fashion was the retort made by Scipio
Nasica<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c016'><sup>[278]</sup></a> to Ennius. Once when Scipio went to Ennius’s house
to speak with him and called him down from the street, one of
his maids replied that he was not at home; and Scipio distinctly
heard Ennius himself tell the maid to say he was not at home,
and so went away. Not long afterwards Ennius came to
Scipio’s house and likewise called to him from below; whereupon
Scipio himself replied in a loud voice that he was not
at home. Then Ennius replied: ‘How? Do I not know thy
voice?’ Scipio said: ‘Thou art too rude. The other day I
believed thy maid when she said thou wert not at home, and
now thou wilt not believe the like from me in person.’</p>

<p class='c001'>76.—“It is also a fine thing when a man is struck in the very
same place where he first struck his fellow. As in the case of
messer Alonso Carillo,<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c016'><sup>[279]</sup></a> who, being at the Spanish court and
having committed some youthful peccadilloes of no great importance,
was put in prison by the king’s order and left there overnight.
The next day he was taken out, and so going to the
palace in the morning, he reached the hall where there were
many cavaliers and ladies. And as they were laughing at his
imprisonment, my lady Boadilla<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c016'><sup>[280]</sup></a> said: ‘Signor Alonso, your mishap
weighed on me heavily, for all your acquaintance thought
the king would have you hanged.’ Then Alonso said quickly:
‘My Lady, I was much afraid of it myself; but then I had hope
that you would ask me to be your husband.’ You see how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>sharp and clever this was, because in Spain (as in many other
countries too) the custom is that when a man is led to the gallows,
his life is given him if a public courtesan begs him for her
husband.</p>

<p>RAPHAEL<br />1483-1520</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Enlarged from a part of Weinwurm’s photograph (no. 1384) of the portrait, in the
National Gallery at Buda-Pest, by Sebastiano Luciani “del Piombo” (1485-1547). In
the Scarpia collection at La Motta di Livenza, this picture passed for years as a portrait
by Raphael of the Ferrarese courtier-poet Antonio Tebaldeo. On purely intrinsic
evidence, both Morelli and Berenson identify it as a portrait of Raphael at the age of
26 or 27 years.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>“In this manner also the painter Raphael replied to two cardinals
with whom he was on familiar terms, and who (to make
him talk) were finding fault in his presence with a picture that
he had painted,—in which St. Peter and St. Paul were represented,—saying
that these two figures were too red in the face.
Then Raphael at once said: ‘My Lords, be not concerned;
because I painted them so with full intention, since we have
reason to believe that St. Peter and St. Paul are as red in
Heaven as you see them here, for shame that their Church
should be governed by such men as you.’<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c016'><sup>[281]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>77.—“Very keen also are those witticisms that have a certain
latent spice of fun in them. As where a husband was making
great lament and weeping for his wife, who had hanged herself
on a fig-tree, another man approached him and plucking him by
the robe, said: ‘Brother, might I as a great favour have a small
branch of that fig-tree to graft upon some tree in my garden?’</p>

<p class='c001'>“Some other witticisms need an air of patience and are
slowly uttered with a certain gravity. As where a rustic, who
was carrying a box on his shoulders, jostled it against Cato, and
then said: ‘Have a care.’ Cato replied: ‘Hast thou aught else
but that chest upon thy shoulders?’<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c016'><sup>[282]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Moreover we laugh when a man has made a blunder, and to
mend it says something of set purpose that seems silly and yet
tends to the object he has in view, and thus keeps himself in
countenance. For instance, in the Florentine Council not long
ago there were (as often happens in these republics) two enemies,
and one of them, who was of the Altoviti family, fell
asleep. And although his adversary, who was of the Alamanni
family, was not speaking and had not spoken, yet to raise a
laugh the man who sat next Altoviti woke him with a touch of
the elbow, and said: ‘Do you not hear what So and So says?
Make answer, as the Signors are asking for your opinion.’
Thereupon Altoviti rose to his feet all drowsy as he was, and
said without stopping to think: ‘My Lords, I say just the opposite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>of what Alamanni said.’ Alamanni replied: ‘But I said nothing.’
‘Then,’ said Altoviti at once, ‘the opposite of whatever
you may say.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of this kind also was what your Urbino physician, master
Serafino, said to a rustic, who had received a hard blow in the
eye so that it was forced quite out, yet decided to seek aid from
master Serafino. On seeing him, although aware that it was
impossible to cure him, still in order to force money from his
hands (just as the blow had forced the eye from his head), the
doctor readily promised to cure him, and accordingly demanded
money from him every day, affirming that he would begin to
recover his sight within five or six days. The poor rustic gave
what little he had; then, seeing that the affair was progressing
slowly, he began to complain of the physician, and to say that
he felt no benefit at all and saw no more with that eye than as
if he had it not in his head. At last master Serafino, seeing that
he would be able to extort little more from the man, said:
‘Brother, you must have patience. You have lost your eye and
there is no longer any help for it; and may God grant that you
do not lose your other eye as well.’ On hearing this, the rustic
began to weep and complain loudly, and said: ‘Master, you
have ruined me and stolen my money. I will complain to my
lord Duke;’ and he made the greatest outcry in the world.
Then, to clear himself, master Serafino said angrily: ‘Ah,
wretched traitor! So you would have two eyes, as city-folk and
rich men have? To perdition with you!’ and accompanied
these words with such fury that the poor rustic was frightened
into silence and quietly went his way in peace, believing himself
to be in the wrong.</p>

<p class='c001'>78.—“It is also fine to explain or interpret a thing jocosely. As
when at the court of Spain there appeared one morning in the
palace a cavalier who was very ugly, and his wife who was very
beautiful, both dressed in white damask (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>damasco</i></span>),—the queen<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c016'><sup>[283]</sup></a>
said to Alonso Carillo: ‘What think you of these two, Alonso?’
‘My Lady,’ replied Alonso, ‘I think she is the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>dama</i></span> (lady), and
he is the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>asco</i></span>,’ which means monster.</p>

<p class='c004'>Reduced from Giraudon’s photograph (no. 1528) of an anonymous bas-relief in the
Louvre. The features strikingly resemble those of Francesco Francia’s medal of Alidosi,
but are very unlike those shown in a picture by Raphael (in the Prado Gallery at
Madrid), which M. Müntz regards as a portrait of the same personage. See <i>L’Archivio
Storico dell’Arte</i> for 1891, pp. 328-32.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>“Another time Rafaello de’ Pazzi<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c016'><sup>[284]</sup></a> saw a letter which the
Prior of Messina<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c016'><sup>[285]</sup></a> had written to a lady of his acquaintance, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>superscription of which read, ‘This missive is to be delivered to
the author of my woes.’ ‘Methinks,’ said Rafaello, ‘this letter
is intended for Paolo Tolosa.’<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c016'><sup>[286]</sup></a> Imagine how the bystanders
laughed, when everyone knew that Paolo Tolosa had lent the
Prior ten thousand ducats, and that he, being a great spendthrift,
found no means to repay them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Akin to this is the giving of friendly admonition in the form
of advice, yet covertly. As Cosimo de’ Medici did to one of his
friends, who was very rich but of moderate education and who
had secured through Cosimo a mission away from Florence.
When on setting out the man asked Cosimo what course he
thought ought to be taken in order to do well in the mission,
Cosimo replied: ‘Wear rose-colour,<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c016'><sup>[287]</sup></a> and say little.’ Of the
same kind was what Count Ludovico said to a man who wished
to travel incognito through a certain dangerous place and knew
not how to disguise himself; and being asked about it, the count
replied: ‘Dress like a doctor or some other man of sense.’
Again, Gianotto de’ Pazzi<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c016'><sup>[288]</sup></a> said to someone who wished to
make a jerkin of as varied colours as he could find: ‘Imitate
the Cardinal of Pavia in word and deed.’</p>

<p class='c001'>79.—“We laugh also at some things that have no connection.
As when someone said the other day to messer Antonio Rizzo<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c016'><sup>[289]</sup></a>
about a certain man from Forli: ‘You may know he is a fool,
for his name is Bartolommeo.’ And another: ‘You are looking
for a Master Stall, and have no horses!’ And: ‘All the fellow
lacks is money and brains.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“And we laugh at certain other things that seem to have sequence.
As recently, when a friend of ours was suspected of
having had the renunciation<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c016'><sup>[290]</sup></a> of a benefice forged, upon another
priest’s falling sick, Antonio Torello<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c016'><sup>[291]</sup></a> said to our friend: ‘Why
do you delay to send for that notary of yours and see about filching
this other benefice?’ Likewise at some things that have no
sequence. As the other day, when the pope sent for messer
Gianluca da Pontremolo and messer Domenico dalla Porta
(who are both hunchbacks as you know),<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c016'><sup>[292]</sup></a> and made them
auditors, saying that he wished to set the Wheel right,—messer
Latino Giovenale<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c016'><sup>[293]</sup></a> said: ‘His Holiness is in errour if he thinks
to make the Wheel right with two wrongs (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>due torti</i></span>).’</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>80.—“We often laugh also when a man admits everything that
is said to him and more too, but pretends to take it in a different
sense. As when Captain Peralta was brought out to fight a duel
with Aldana, and Captain Molart<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c016'><sup>[294]</sup></a> (who was Aldana’s second)
asked Peralta on his oath if he wore any amulets or charms to
keep him from being wounded; Peralta swore that he wore no
amulets or charms or relics or objects of devotion in which he
had faith. Whereupon, to taunt him with being a heretic, Molart
said: ‘Do not trouble yourself about it, for without your
oath I believe you have no faith in Christ himself.’<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c016'><sup>[295]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Moreover it is a fine thing to use metaphors seasonably in
such cases. As when our friend master Marcantonio said to Bottone
da Cesena,<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c016'><sup>[296]</sup></a> who was goading him with words: ‘Bottone,
Bottone, you will one day be the button (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>bottone</i></span>), and your
button-hole will be the halter.’ Another time, master Marcantonio
having composed a very long comedy in several acts,
this same Bottone said to master Marcantonio: ‘To play your
comedy, all the timber there is in Slavonia will be needed for
the setting.’ Master Marcantonio replied: ‘While for the setting
of your tragedy, three sticks will be quite enough.’<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c016'><sup>[297]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>81.—“We often use a word in which there is a hidden meaning
remote from the one we seem to intend. As was done by my lord
Prefect here, on hearing mention of a certain captain who in his
time had for the most part been defeated but just then had
chanced to win. And the speaker telling that when the captain
made his entry into the place in question, he had on a very
beautiful crimson velvet doublet, which he always wore after
his victories, my lord Prefect said: ‘It must be new.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nor is there less laughter when we reply to something that our
interlocutor has not said, or pretend to believe he has done
something that he has not but ought to have done. As when
Andrea Coscia,<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c016'><sup>[298]</sup></a> having gone to visit a gentleman who rudely
kept his seat and left his guest to stand, said: ‘Since your Lordship

</div>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Reduced from the central part of Braun’s photograph (no. 42.040) of the triple portrait,
in the Pitti Gallery at Florence, painted between 1517 and 1519 by Raphael (1483-1520)
with the assistance of his pupil Giulio Pippi, better known as Giulio Romano,
(1492-1546).</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>82.—“We laugh also when a man accuses himself of some
fault humourously. As when I told my lord Duke’s chaplain
the other day that my lord Cardinal<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c016'><sup>[300]</sup></a> had a chaplain who said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>mass faster than he, he answered me: ‘It is not possible;’ and
coming close to my ear, he said: ‘You must know, I do not recite
a third of the silent prayers.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“Again, a priest at Milan having died, Biagino Crivello<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c016'><sup>[301]</sup></a>
begged his benefice of the Duke,<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c016'><sup>[302]</sup></a> who however was minded to
give it to someone else. At last Biagino saw that further argument
was of no avail, and said: ‘What! After I have had the
priest killed, why will you not give me his benefice?’</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is often amusing also to express desire for those things
that cannot be. As the other day, when one of our friends saw
all these gentlemen playing at fence while he was lying on his
bed, and said: ‘Ah, how glad I should be if this too were a fitting
exercise for a strong man and a good soldier!’</p>

<p class='c001'>“Moreover it is an amusing and spicy style of talk, and especially
for grave and dignified persons, to reply the opposite of
what the person spoken to desires, but slowly and with a little
air of doubtful and hesitating deliberation. As was once the
case with King Alfonso I of Aragon,<a href='#f269' class='c016'><sup>[269]</sup></a> who gave a servant
weapons, horses and clothes, because the fellow said he had
the night before dreamed that his Highness had given him all
these things; and again not long afterwards the same servant
said he had that night dreamed that the king gave him a goodly
sum of gold florins, whereupon the king replied: ‘Put no trust in
dreams henceforth, because they are not true.’ Of like sort also
was the pope’s reply to the Bishop of Cervia,<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c016'><sup>[303]</sup></a> who said to him
in order to sound his purpose: ‘Holy Father, it is said all over
Rome, and the palace too, that your Holiness is making me
governor.’ Then the pope replied: ‘Let them talk,—they are
only knaves. Have no fear there is any truth in it.’</p>

<p class='c001'>83.—“Perhaps, my Lords, I might collect still many other occasions
that give opportunity for humourous sallies: such as things
said with shyness, with admiration, with threats, out of season,
with excessive anger; besides these, certain other conditions
that provoke laughter when they occur: sometimes a kind of
wondering taciturnity, sometimes mere laughter itself when
untimely. But methinks I have now said enough, for I believe
that pleasantry which takes the form of words does not exceed
the limits we have discussed.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>“Then, as to that which is shown in action, although it has
numberless forms, it still is comprised under a few heads. But in
both kinds the main thing is to cheat expectation and reply
otherwise than the hearer looks for; and if the pleasantry is to
find favour, it must needs be seasoned with deceit or dissimulation
or ridicule or censure or simile, or whatever other style a
man chooses to employ. And while pleasantries provoke laughter,
yet with this laughter they produce divers other effects: for
some contain a certain elegance and modest pleasantness, others
a hidden or an open sting, others have a taint of grossness,
others move to laughter as soon as they are heard, others the
more they are thought of, others make us blush as well as laugh,
others rouse a little anger. But in all methods we must consider
our hearers’ state of mind, for to the afflicted jocosity often
brings greater affliction, and there are certain maladies that are
aggravated the more medicine is employed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hence if the Courtier pays heed to time, persons and his
own rank, in his banter and amusing talk, and uses them not too
often (for in truth it begets tedium to be harping on this all day,
in all kinds of converse, in season and out), he may be called a
man of humour; taking care also not to be so sharp and biting as
to be thought spiteful, assailing causelessly or with evident rancour:
either those who are too powerful, which is imprudent; or
those who are too weak, which is cruel; or those who are too
wicked, which is useless; or saying things to offend those he
would not offend, which is ignorance. Yet there are some who
feel bound to speak and assail recklessly whenever they can, let
the consequence be what it may. And among these last, some
there are who do not scruple to tarnish the honour of a noble
lady, for the sake of saying something humourous; which is a
very evil thing and worthy the heaviest punishment, for in this
regard ladies are to be numbered among the weak, and so ought
not to be assailed, since they have no weapons to defend them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Besides these things, he who would be agreeable and amusing
must have a certain natural aptitude for all kinds of fun, and
must adapt his behaviour, gestures and face accordingly; and
the graver and more serious and impassive his face is, the more
spicy and keen will he make his sallies seem.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span><a id='sec2.84'></a>84.—“But you, messer Federico, who thought to take your ease
under this leafless tree and in my arid talk, I am sure you have
repented of it and think you have found your way to the Montefiore
Inn.<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c016'><sup>[304]</sup></a> Therefore it will be well for you, like a practised
postman, to rise somewhat earlier than usual and take up your
journey, in order to escape from a bad inn.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay,” replied messer Federico, “I have come to so good an
inn that I mean to tarry in it longer than I first intended. So I
shall go on taking my ease until you have finished the whole discourse
appointed, of which you have left out one part that you
mentioned in the beginning—that is, practical jokes; and it is not
right for you to cheat the company of this. But as you have
taught us many fine things about pleasantries, and have made us
bold to use them by the example of so many singular geniuses,
great men, princes, kings, and popes,—so too in practical jokes I
think you will give us such daring that we shall venture to try
some even upon you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Bernardo said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will not be the first; but perhaps you may not succeed,
for I have already endured so many of them that I am on my guard
against everything, like dogs who are afraid of cold water
after once being scalded with hot. However, since you will
have me speak of this also, I think I can despatch it in a few
words.</p>

<p class='c001'>85.—“It seems to me that practical joking is naught else but
friendly deceit in things that do not offend or that offend only a
little. And just as in pleasantry it arouses laughter to say something
contrary to expectation, so in practical joking it arouses
laughter to do something contrary to expectation. And the
cleverer and more discreet these jokes are, the more they please
and are applauded; for he often gives offence who tries to play a
practical joke recklessly, and afterwards quarrels and serious
enmities arise in consequence.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But the occasions that give opportunity for practical jokes
are nearly the same as in the case of pleasantries. So not to repeat
them, I will merely say that practical jokes are of two
kinds, each of which kinds might be further divided into classes.
One kind is where anyone is cleverly tricked in a fine and amusing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>manner; the other is where a net is cast, as it were, and
a little bait is offered, so that the victim himself hastens to be
tricked.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of the first kind was the joke that two great ladies, whom I
do not wish to name, lately had played upon them by means of a
Spaniard called Castillo.”<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c016'><sup>[305]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lady Duchess said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“And why do you not wish to name them?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Bernardo replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I would not have them take offence.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lady Duchess answered, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is not amiss to play jokes now and then even upon great
lords. Indeed I have heard of many being played upon Duke
Federico, upon King Alfonso of Aragon, upon Queen Isabella
of Spain, and upon many other great princes; and they not
only did not take offence, but rewarded the perpetrators liberally.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Bernardo replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not even for the hope of reward will I name those ladies.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“As you please,” answered my lady Duchess.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Bernardo went on to say:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is not long since there arrived at the court (of I know
whom) a Bergamasque rustic on business for a courtier gentleman;
and this rustic was so well attired and elegantly appointed
that, although he had been only used to tend cattle and
knew no other trade, anyone who did not hear him speak
would have taken him for a gallant cavalier. Now, being told
that a Spanish follower of Cardinal Borgia<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c016'><sup>[306]</sup></a> had arrived, and
that he was called Castillo and was exceedingly clever, a musician,
a dancer, a <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>ballatore</i></span>,<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c016'><sup>[307]</sup></a> and the most accomplished Courtier
in all Spain,—these two ladies were filled with extreme
desire to speak with him, and straightway sent for him. And
after receiving him with ceremony, they made him sit down and
began to speak to him with the greatest distinction before all the
company; and there were few of those present who did not
know that the fellow was a Bergamasque cow-herd. So when
these ladies were seen entertaining him with so much respect
and honouring him so signally, the laughter was very hearty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>the more so as the good man spoke his native Bergamasque
dialect all the while.<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c016'><sup>[308]</sup></a> But the gentlemen who played the trick
had told these ladies in the beginning that he was among other
things a great joker, and spoke all languages admirably and
especially rustic Lombard. Thus they continually imagined
that he was pretending, and they often turned to each other
with an air of surprise, and said: ‘Listen to this prodigy, how
well he counterfeits the language!’ In short, the conversation
lasted so long that everyone’s sides ached from laughing; and
he himself could not help giving so many tokens of his gentility
that even these ladies were at last convinced, albeit with great
difficulty, that he was what he was.</p>

<p class='c001'>86.—“We meet practical jokes of this kind every day; but
among the rest those are amusing which at first excite alarm
and turn out well in the end; for even the victim laughs at
himself when he sees that his fears were groundless.</p>

<p class='c001'>“For instance, I was staying at Paglia<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c016'><sup>[309]</sup></a> one night, and in the
same inn where I was there happened to be three companions
besides myself (two from Pistoia and the other from Prato),
who sat down to play after supper, as men often do. They had
not been playing long before one of the two Pistoians lost all he
had and was left without a farthing, so that he began to lament
and to curse and swear roundly; and he retired to sleep blaspheming
thus. After gaming awhile, the other two resolved
to play a trick upon the one who had gone to bed. So, making
sure that he was really asleep, they put out all the lights
and covered the fire; then they began to talk loud and to make
as much noise as they could, pretending to quarrel over their
play, and one of them said: ‘You’ve drawn the under card;’
and the other denied it, saying: ‘And you have wagered on four
of a suit; let us deal again;’<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c016'><sup>[310]</sup></a> and the like, with such an uproar
that the sleeper awoke. And perceiving that his friends were
playing and talking as if they saw the cards, he rubbed his
eyes a little, and seeing no light in the room, he said: ‘What
the devil do you mean by shouting all night?’ Then he lay
back again as if to go to sleep.</p>

<p class='c001'>“His two friends made no reply, but went on as before;
whereat the man began to wonder (now that he was more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>awake) and seeing that there was really no fire or glimmer of
any kind, and that still his friends were playing and quarrelling,
he said: ‘And how can you see the cards without light?’ One
of the two replied: ‘You must have lost your sight along with
your money; don’t you see with these two candles we have
here?’ The man who was abed lifted himself upon his arms,
and said rather angrily: ‘Either I am drunk or blind, or you are
lying.’ The two got up and groped their way to the bed, laughing
and pretending to think that he was making sport of them;
and still he answered: ‘I say I do not see you.’ Finally the two
began to feign great surprise, and one said to the other: ‘Alas,
methinks he speaks the truth. Hand me that candle, and let us
see if perchance there is something wrong with his sight.’ Then
the poor fellow took it for certain that he had become blind, and
weeping bitterly he said: ‘Oh my brothers, I am blind;’ and he
at once began to call on Our Lady of Loreto, and to implore her
to pardon the blasphemies and maledictions that he had heaped
upon her for the loss of his money. His two companions kept
comforting him, and said: ‘It can’t be that you do not see
us; ’tis some fancy you’ve got into your head.’ ‘Alas,’ replied
the other, ‘this is no fancy, for I see no more than as if I had
never had any eyes in my head.’ ‘Yet your sight is clear,’ replied
the two, and one said to the other: ‘See how well he opens
his eyes! And how bright they are! Who could believe that
he doesn’t see?’ The unhappy man wept more loudly all the
while, and begged mercy of God.</p>

<p class='c001'>“At last they said to him: ‘Make a vow to go in penance to
Our Lady of Loreto,<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c016'><sup>[311]</sup></a> barefoot and naked, for this is the best
remedy that can be found; and meanwhile we will go to Acquapendente<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c016'><sup>[312]</sup></a>
and those other places hard by to see some doctor,
nor will we fail to do everything we can for you.’ Then the
poor fellow quickly knelt by his bed, and with endless tears and
bitter penitence for his blasphemy he made a solemn vow to go
naked to Our Lady of Loreto, and to offer her a pair of silver
eyes, and to eat no flesh on Wednesday or eggs on Friday, and
to fast on bread and water every Saturday in honour of Our
Lady, if she would grant him the mercy of restoring his sight.
His two companions went into another room, struck a light, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>laughing their very loudest, came back to the unhappy man,
who was relieved of his great anguish, as you may imagine, but
was so stunned by the terror that he had passed through, that he
could neither laugh nor even speak; and his two companions did
nothing but tease him, saying that he must fulfil all his vows,
because he had obtained the mercy which he sought.</p>

<p class='c001'>87.—“Of the other kind of practical joke, where a man deceives
himself, I shall give no other example than the one that was
played on me not very long ago.</p>

<p class='c001'>“During the last carnival, my friend Monsignor of San Pietro
ad Vincula<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c016'><sup>[313]</sup></a> (who knows how fond I am of playing tricks on
the friars when I am masked, and who had carefully arranged
beforehand what he meant to do) came one day with Monsignor
of Aragon<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c016'><sup>[314]</sup></a> and a few other cardinals, to certain windows
in the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Banchi</i></span>,<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c016'><sup>[315]</sup></a> ostensibly for the purpose of seeing the maskers
pass, as the custom is at Rome. I came along in my mask,
and seeing a friar (somewhat apart) who had a little air of hesitation,
I thought I had found my chance and rushed upon him like
a hungry falcon on its prey. And first having asked him who
he was and received his answer, I pretended to know him, and
with many words began to make him think that the chief constable
was out in search of him (because of certain evil reports
that had been received against him), and to urge him to go with
me to the Chancery,<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c016'><sup>[316]</sup></a> where I would put him in safety. Frightened
and trembling from head to foot, the friar seemed not to
know what to do and said he feared being taken if he went far
from San Celso.<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c016'><sup>[317]</sup></a> I said so much to encourage him, however,
that he mounted my crupper; and then I thought I had fully
succeeded in my scheme. So I at once began to make for the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Banchi</i></span>, my horse frisking and kicking the while. Now imagine
what a fine sight a friar made on a masker’s crupper, with cloak
flying and head tossed to and fro, and looking all the time as if
he were about to fall.</p>

<p class='c001'>“At this fine spectacle those gentlemen began to throw eggs
on us from the windows, as did all the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Banchi</i></span> people and everyone
who was there,—so that hail never fell from heaven with
greater violence than from those windows fell the eggs, most of
which came on me. Being masked as I was, I did not care and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>thought that all the laughter was for the friar and not for me;
and so I went up and down the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Banchi</i></span> several times with this
fury always at my back, although the friar with tears in his eyes
begged me to let him dismount and not to shame his cloth in this
way. Then the knave had eggs given him on the sly by some
lackeys stationed there for the purpose, and pretending to hold
me fast to keep from falling, he broke them over my breast, often
over my head, and sometimes on my very brow, until I was completely
bedaubed. Finally, when everyone was weary both of
laughing and of throwing eggs, he jumped off my crupper, and
pushing back his cowl showed me his long hair, and said: ‘Messer
Bernardo, I am one of the grooms at San Pietro ad Vincula,
and it is I who take care of your little mule.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know not which was then greatest, my grief, my anger, or
my shame. However, as the least of evils, I set out fast for
home, and dared not make an appearance the next morning; but
the laughter raised by this trick lasted not only the next day,
but nearly until now.”</p>

<p class='c001'>88.—And so, after they had again laughed awhile at the story,
messer Bernardo continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is another very amusing kind of practical joke, which
gives opportunity for pleasantry as well, when we pretend to
think that a man wishes to do something which in fact he does
not wish to do. For instance, one evening after supper, when I
was on the bridge at Lyons and jesting with Cesare Beccadello<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c016'><sup>[318]</sup></a>
as we walked along, we began to seize each other by the arm as
if we were bent on wrestling, for by chance no one else appeared
on the bridge at the time. While we were standing thus,
two Frenchmen came up, and on seeing our dispute they asked
what the matter was, and stopped to try to separate us, thinking
that we were quarrelling in earnest. Then I said quickly: ‘Help
me, Sirs, for this poor gentleman loses his reason at certain
changes of the moon, and you see he is now trying to throw himself
off the bridge into the water.’ Thereupon these two men
ran, and with my aid seized Cesare and held him very tight; and
he, telling me all the while that I was mad, tried harder to free
himself from their hands, and they held him all the tighter.
Thus the passers-by gathered to look at the disturbance, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>everyone ran up. And the more poor Cesare struck out with his
hands and feet (for he was now beginning to grow angry), the
more people arrived; and from the great effort that he made,
they fully believed he was trying to jump into the river, and on
that account held him the tighter. So that a great crowd of
men carried him bodily to the inn, all dishevelled, capless, pale
with anger and shame; for nothing he said availed him, partly
because the Frenchmen did not understand him, and also partly
because, as I walked along leading them to the inn, I kept lamenting
the poor man’s misfortune in being thus stricken mad.</p>

<p class='c001'>89.—“Now, as we have said, it would be possible to talk at
length about practical jokes; but suffice it to repeat that the
occasions which give opportunity for them are the same as in
the case of pleasantries. Moreover we have an infinity of
examples because we see them every day. Among others there
are many amusing ones in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Novelle</cite></span> of Boccaccio, like those
which Bruno and Buffalmacco played upon their friend Calandrino
and upon master Simone,<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c016'><sup>[319]</sup></a> and many others played by
women, that are truly clever and fine.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I remember having known in my time many other amusing
men of this sort, and among others a certain Sicilian student at
Padua, called Ponzio;<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c016'><sup>[320]</sup></a> who once saw a peasant with a pair of
fat capons. And pretending that he wished to buy them, he
struck a bargain, and told the fellow to come home with him and
get some breakfast besides the price agreed on. So he led the
peasant to a place where there was a bell-tower standing apart
from its church<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c016'><sup>[321]</sup></a> so that one could walk around it; and just
opposite one of the four sides of the tower was the end of a little
lane. Here Ponzio, who had already settled what he meant to
do, said to the peasant: ‘I have wagered these capons with one
of my friends, who says that this tower measures quite forty feet
around, while I say it does not. And just before I found you, I
had bought this twine to measure it. Now, before we go home
I wish to find out which of the two has won.’ And so saying,
he drew the twine from his sleeve, gave one end of it to the
peasant, and said: ‘Hand them here.’ Thereupon he took the
capons, and holding the other end of the twine as if he were
going to measure, he started to walk around the tower, first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>making the peasant stay and hold the twine against that side of
it which was farthest from the one that looked up the little lane.
When he reached this other side, he stuck a nail into the wall,
tied the twine to it, and leaving the man there he quietly went
off with the capons up the little lane. The peasant stood still a
long time waiting for Ponzio to finish the measurement; at last,—after
he had several times said: ‘What are you doing there
so long?’—he went to look, and found that it was not Ponzio
who was holding the twine, but a nail stuck in the wall, and that
this was all the pay left him for the capons. Ponzio played
numberless tricks of this sort.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There have also been many other men who were amusing in
like manner, such as Gonnella, Meliolo in his day,<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c016'><sup>[322]</sup></a> and at the
present time our friends Fra Mariano<a href='#f60' class='c016'><sup>[60]</sup></a> and Fra Serafino<a href='#f61' class='c016'><sup>[61]</sup></a> here,
and many whom you all know. And doubtless this method is
well enough for men who have no other business, but I think the
Courtier’s practical jokes ought to be somewhat farther removed
from scurrility. Care must be taken also not to let practical
joking degenerate into knavery, as we see in the case of many
rogues, who go through the world with sundry wiles to get
money, now pretending one thing and now another. Moreover
the Courtier’s tricks must not be too rude; and above all let him
pay respect and reverence to women in this as in all other
things, and especially where their honour may be touched.”</p>

<p class='c001'>90.—Then my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed, messer Bernardo, you are too partial towards
women. And why would you have men pay more respect to
women than women to men? Should not our honour be as dear
to us, forsooth, as theirs to them? Do you think that women
ought to taunt men with words and nonsense without the least
restraint in anything, and that men should quietly endure it and
thank them into the bargain?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Bernardo replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not say that in their pleasantries and practical jokes
women ought not to use towards men the same respect which
we have before described; but I do say they may taunt men
with unchastity more freely than men may taunt them. And
this is because we have made unto ourselves a law, whereby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>free living is in us neither vice nor fault nor disgrace, while in
women it is such utter infamy and shame that she of whom evil
is once spoken is disgraced forever, whether the imputation<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c016'><sup>[323]</sup></a>
cast upon her be false or true. Wherefore, since speaking of
women’s honour brings such risk of doing them grievous harm,
I say we ought to attack them in some other way, and to abstain
from this; because to strike too hard with our pleasantries and
practical jokes, is to exceed the bounds that we have before said
are befitting a gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c001'>91.—As messer Bernardo paused a little here, my lord Ottaviano
Fregoso said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My lord Gaspar might answer you that this law you refer to,
which we have made unto ourselves, is perhaps not so unreasonable
as it seems to you. For since women were very imperfect
creatures and of little or no worth in comparison with men, and
since of themselves they were not capable of performing any
worthy act,—it was necessary by fear of shame and infamy to
lay upon them a restraint that might impart some quality of
goodness to them almost against their will. And chastity
seemed more needful for them than any other quality, in order
to have certainty as to our offspring; hence it was necessary to
use every possible skill, art and way to make women chaste, and
almost to permit them to be of little worth in all things else and
to do constantly the reverse of what they ought. Therefore,
since they are allowed to commit all other faults without blame,
if we taunt them with those defects which (as we have said) are
all permitted to them and therefore not incongruous in them,
and of which they take no heed,—we shall never arouse
laughter; for you said awhile ago that laughter is aroused by
certain things that are incongruous.”</p>

<p class='c001'>92.—Then my lady Duchess said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You speak thus of women, my lord Ottaviano, and then you
complain that they love you not.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not complain of this,” replied my lord Ottaviano, “but
rather thank them in that they do not, by loving me, force me to
love them. Nor am I speaking my own mind, but saying that
my lord Gaspar might use these arguments.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Bernardo said:</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“Verily it would be a great gain to women if they could conciliate
two such great enemies of theirs as you and my lord
Gaspar are.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am not their enemy,” replied my lord Gaspar, “but you are
indeed an enemy of men; for if you would not have women
taunted as to their honour, you ought also to impose on them a
law that they shall not taunt men for that which is as shameful
to us as unchastity is to women. And why was not
Alonso Carillo’s retort to my lady Boadilla (about hoping to
escape with his life by being asked to become her husband) as
seemly in him, as it was for her to say that all who knew him
thought the king was about to have him hanged? And why was
it not as allowable for Riciardo Minutoli to deceive Filippello’s
wife and get her to go to that resort, as for Beatrice to make her
husband Egano<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c016'><sup>[324]</sup></a> get out of bed and be cudgelled by Anichino,
after she had long been with the latter? And for that other
woman to tie a string to her toe and make her husband believe
that she was someone else?—since you say that these women’s
pranks in Giovanni Boccaccio are so clever and fine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>93.—Then messer Bernardo said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lords, as my task was simply to discuss pleasantries, I
do not mean to go outside my subject. And I think I have
already told why it does not seem to me befitting to attack
women in their honour either by word or deed, and have imposed
on them as well a rule that they shall not touch men in a
tender spot.</p>

<p class='c001'>“As for the pranks and sallies cited by you, my lord Gaspar,
I grant that although what Alonso said to my lady Boadilla
may touch a little on her chastity, it still does not displease me,
because it is very remote, and is so veiled that it may be taken
innocently, and the speaker might disguise his meaning and
declare he had not meant it. He said another that was to my
thinking very unseemly. And it was this: as the queen<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c016'><sup>[325]</sup></a> was
passing my lady Boadilla’s house,<a href='#f280' class='c016'><sup>[280]</sup></a> Alonso saw the door all
blackened with pictures of those indecencies that are painted
about inns in such variety; and turning to the Countess of Castagneta,<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c016'><sup>[326]</sup></a>
he said: ‘There, my Lady, are the heads of the game
that my lady Boadilla slays in hunting every day.’ You see that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>while the metaphor is clever and aptly borrowed from hunters
(who take pride in having many heads of beasts fastened on their
doors), yet it is scurrilous and disgraceful. Besides which, it
was not an answer to anything; for it is far less rude to say a
thing by way of retort, because then it seems to have been provoked
and needs must be impromptu.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Returning, however, to the subject of tricks played by women,
I do not say they do well to deceive their husbands, but I say
that some of those deceptions (which Giovanni Boccaccio recounts
of women) are fine and very clever, and especially those
which you yourself told. But in my opinion the trick played by
Riciardo Minutoli goes too far, and is much more heartless than
the one played by Beatrice; because Riciardo Minutoli did much
greater wrong to Filippello’s wife than Beatrice did to her husband
Egano, for by his deception Riciardo forced the woman’s
will and made her do with herself something that she did not
wish to do, while Beatrice deceived her husband in order that
she might do with herself something that pleased her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>94.—Then my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Beatrice can be excused on no other plea than that of love,
which ought to be allowed in the case of men as well as in that
of women.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Bernardo replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“No doubt the passion of love affords great excuse for every
fault. But for my part I think that a gentleman of worth, who
is in love, ought to be sincere and truthful in this as in all things
else; and if it be true that to betray even an enemy is such a
vile act and abominable crime, consider how much more heinous
the offence ought to be deemed when it is committed against
one whom we love.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Moreover, I think that every gentle lover endures so many
toils, so many vigils, braves so many perils, sheds so many tears,
employs so many means and ways to please the lady of his love,—not
chiefly in order to possess her person, but to capture the
fortress of her mind, and to shatter those hardest diamonds, to
melt that coldest ice, that often are in the tender breast of
woman. This, I think, is the true and sound pleasure and the
purposed goal of every noble heart. For myself, were I in love,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>I certainly should prefer to be assured that she whom I served
returned my love from her heart and had given me her mind,—without
ever having any other satisfaction from her,—than to
enjoy her to the full against her will; for in such case I should
deem myself the master of a lifeless body. Hence they who
pursue their desires by means of such trickery, which might
perhaps be called treachery rather than trickery, do injury to
others; nor have they yet that bliss which is to be desired in
love, if they possess the body without the will.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The same I say of certain others who use enchantments in
their love, charms and sometimes force, sometimes sleeping
potions and such like things. Be assured, too, that gifts much
lessen the pleasures of love; for a man may suspect that he is
not loved and that his lady makes a show of loving him in order
to profit by it. Hence you see that great ladies’ love is prized
because it could hardly spring from other source than real and
true affection, nor is it credible that a great lady should ever
pretend to love one of her inferiors unless she loves him truly.”</p>

<p class='c001'>95.—Then my lord Gaspar replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not deny that the purpose, toils and dangers of lovers
ought to have their aim directed chiefly towards the conquest of
the mind rather than of the body of their beloved. But I say
that these deceits, which you call treachery in men and trickery
in women, are excellent means of attaining this aim, for whoever
possesses a woman’s person is master of her mind as well. And
if you remember rightly, Filippello’s wife, after much lament
over the deceit practised on her by Riciardo, discovered how
much more delicious than her husband’s were the kisses of her
lover, and her coldness to Riciardo changed to sweet affection,
so that from that day forth she loved him most tenderly. Thus
it came about that what his frequent fond visits, his gifts and
countless other tokens shown unceasingly, could not affect, a
taste of his embraces soon accomplished. You now see that this
same trickery, or treachery as you would call it, was a good way
to capture the fortress of her mind.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Bernardo said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You advance a very false premise, for if women always surrendered
their mind to the man who possessed their person, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>wife would be found who did not love her husband more than
every other person in the world; the contrary of which we find
to be the case. But Giovanni Boccaccio was very unjustly hostile
to women, as you are also.”<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c016'><sup>[327]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>96.—My lord Gaspar replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am not at all hostile to them; but there are very few men
of worth who as a rule make any account of women whatever,
although for their own purposes they sometimes pretend the
contrary.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Bernardo replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You wrong not women only, but also all men who hold them
in respect. However, as I said, I do not wish for the present to
go outside my original subject of practical joking, and enter
upon so difficult an enterprise as would be the defence of women
against you, who are a most redoubtable warrior. So I will
make an end of this talk of mine, which has perhaps been far
longer than was necessary, and certainly less amusing than you
expected. And since I see the ladies sit so quiet, enduring your
insults thus patiently as they do, I shall henceforth regard a part
of what my lord Ottaviano said as true, namely, that they care
not what other evil is said of them, provided they be not taunted
with lack of chastity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then at a signal from my lady Duchess, many of the ladies
rose to their feet, and all ran laughing towards my lord Gaspar,
as if to shower blows upon him and treat him as the bacchants
treated Orpheus,<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c016'><sup>[328]</sup></a>—meanwhile saying:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You shall see now whether we care if evil be said of us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>97.—Thus, partly because of the laughter and partly because
everyone rose to his feet, the drowsiness that had seized the
eyes and mind of some, seemed to flee away; but my lord
Gaspar began to say:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You see that being in the wrong, they would fain use force
and thus end the discussion by giving us a Braccesque leave, as
the saying is.”<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c016'><sup>[329]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lady Emilia replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, that shall not help you; for when you saw messer Bernardo
wearied by his long talk, you began to say all manner of
evil about women, thinking to have no antagonist. But we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>shall put a fresh champion in the field to fight you, to the end
that your offence may not go long unpunished.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So, turning to the Magnifico Giuliano, who had thus far
spoken little, she said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are accounted the defender of women’s honour; wherefore
the time has come for you to show that you have not acquired
this title falsely. And if hitherto you have ever found
profit in your office, you ought now to consider that by putting
down so bitter an enemy of ours, you will render all women still
more beholden to you, so much so that although nothing else be
ever done but requite you, yet the obligation must always stand
and can never fully be requited.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec2.98'></a>98.—Then the Magnifico Giuliano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lady, methinks you do your enemy much honour, and
your defender very little; for so far my lord Gaspar has certainly
said nothing against women that messer Bernardo has not most
consummately answered. And I believe we all know that it is
fitting for the Courtier to show women the greatest reverence,
and that he who is discreet and courteous must never taunt
them with lack of chastity, either in jest or in earnest. Therefore,
to discuss such obvious truth as this, is almost to cast doubt
upon that which is undoubted. But indeed I think my lord
Ottaviano went rather too far when he said that women are
very imperfect creatures, incapable of any worthy action, and
possessed of little or no dignity in comparison with men. And
as trust is often placed in those who have great authority, even
when they say what is not the exact truth and also when they
speak in jest,—my lord Gaspar suffered himself to be led by my
lord Ottaviano’s words to say that wise men make no account
of women whatever, which is most false. On the contrary, I
have known very few men of merit who did not love and honour
women,—whose worth (and so whose dignity) I regard as
in no wise inferior to men’s.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>“Yet if this were to be the subject of dispute, women’s cause
would be at serious disadvantage; because these gentlemen
have described a Courtier so excellent and of such heavenly
accomplishments, that whoso undertook to consider him as they
have pictured him, would imagine that women’s merits could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>not attain that pitch. But if the contest were to be fair, we
should first need to have someone as clever and eloquent as
Count Ludovico and messer Federico are, to describe a Court
Lady with all the perfections proper to woman, just as they have
described the Courtier with the perfections proper to man. And
then, if he who defended their cause were of only moderate
cleverness and eloquence, I think that with truth for ally, he
would clearly prove that women are as full of virtue as men
are.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay,” replied my lady Emilia, “far more so; and in proof of
this, you see that virtue (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>la virtù</i></span>) is feminine, and vice (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>il vizio</i></span>)
is masculine.”<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c016'><sup>[330]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>99.—Then my lord Gaspar laughed, and turning to messer
Niccolò Frisio, said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“What think you of this, Frisio?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Frisio replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am sorry for my lord Magnifico, who has been beguiled by
my lady Emilia’s promises and soft words into the errour of saying
that which I blush for on his behalf.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lady Emilia replied, still laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will be ashamed rather of yourself, when you see my
lord Gaspar confuted, confessing his own and your errour, and
imploring a pardon that we shall refuse to grant him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lady Duchess said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“As the hour is very late, let the whole matter be postponed
until to-morrow; especially since it seems to me wise to follow
my lord Magnifico’s counsel, which is: that before we enter
upon this controversy, a Court Lady be described with all her
perfections, just as these gentlemen have described the perfect
Courtier.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lady Emilia said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lady, God forbid that we chance to entrust this task to
any fellow-conspirator of my lord Gaspar, who will describe us
a Court Lady that can do naught but cook and spin.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Frisio said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“But this is her proper calling.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lady Emilia said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am willing to trust my lord Magnifico, who will (with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>cleverness and good sense which I know are his) imagine the
highest perfection that can be desired in woman, and will set it
forth in beautiful language too; and then we shall have something
to offer against my lord Gaspar’s false aspersions.”</p>

<p class='c001'>100.—“My Lady,” replied the Magnifico, “I am not sure how
well advised you are to impose on me an enterprise of such
weight that I really do not feel myself sufficient for it. Nor am
I like the Count and messer Federico, who have with their eloquence
described a Courtier that never was and perhaps never
can be. Still, if it pleases you to have me bear this burden, at
least let it be upon the same conditions as in the case of these
other gentlemen, namely: that everyone may contradict me
when he pleases; for I shall take it, not as contradiction, but as
aid; and perhaps by the correction of my mistakes we shall discover
that perfection of the Court Lady which we seek.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I hope,” replied my lady Duchess, “that your talk will be of
such sort that little may be found in it to contradict. So give
your whole mind to it, and describe for us such a woman that
these adversaries of ours shall be ashamed to say she is not
equal in worth to the Courtier; of whom it will be well for messer
Federico to say no more, since the Courtier has been only too
well adorned by him, especially as there is now need to give
him a paragon in woman.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Federico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lady, little or nothing is now left for me to tell about the
Courtier; and what I thought of saying has been driven from
my mind by messer Bernardo’s pleasantries.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If that be so,” said my lady Duchess, “let us come together
again early to-morrow, and we shall have time to attend to both
matters.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Thereupon all rose to their feet, and having reverently taken
leave of my lady Duchess, everyone went to his own room.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c005'>
    <div>TO MESSER ALFONSO ARIOSTO</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec3.1'></a>1.—We read that Pythagoras very ingeniously and cleverly
discovered the measure of Hercules’s body; and the way was this:
it being known that the space where the Olympic games were
celebrated every five years, before the temple of Olympian Jove
near Elis, in Achaia,<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c016'><sup>[331]</sup></a> had been measured by Hercules, and a
stadium made six hundred and twenty-five times the length of
his own foot; and that the other stadia which were afterwards
established throughout Greece by later generations, were likewise
of the length of six hundred and twenty-five feet, and yet
were somewhat shorter than the first one: by this proportion
Pythagoras easily reckoned how much larger Hercules’s foot
was than other human feet; and thus, knowing the measure of
the foot, from this he argued that the whole body of Hercules
was larger than other men’s in the same proportion that the
first stadium bore to the other stadia.</p>

<p class='c001'>So you, my dear messer Alfonso, by the same reasoning may
clearly see, from this small part of the whole body, how superior
the court of Urbino was to all others in Italy, considering how
much the games that were devised for the refreshment of minds
wearied by the most arduous labours, were superior to those
that were practised in the other courts of Italy. And if these
were of such sort, think what were the other worthy pursuits to
which our minds were bent and wholly given; and of this I confidently
make bold to speak with hope of being believed; for I
am not praising things so ancient that I might be allowed to
invent, but can prove what I affirm by the testimony of many
men worthy of faith, who are still living and personally saw and
knew the life and behaviour that one time flourished in that
court: and I hold myself bound, as far as I can, to strive with
every effort to rescue this bright memory from mortal oblivion,
and by my writing to make it live in the hearts of posterity.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Wherefore perhaps in the future there will not be lacking
some to envy our century for this also; since no one reads the
wonderful exploits of the ancients, who in his mind does not
conceive a somewhat higher opinion of those that are written of
than the books themselves seem able to express, however divinely
they be written. Even so we desire that all to whose hands this
work of ours shall come (if indeed it shall ever be worthy of such
favour as to deserve being seen by noble cavaliers and virtuous
ladies) may assume and take for certain that the court of Urbino
was far more excellent, and adorned by men of singular worth,
than we can express in writing; and if we had as great eloquence
as they had merit, we should have no need of other proof
to make our words believed by those who saw it not.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec3.2'></a>2.—Now the company being assembled the next day at the
accustomed hour and place, and seated in silence, everyone
turned his eyes to messer Federico and to the Magnifico Giuliano,
waiting to see which of them would begin the discussion.
Wherefore my lady Duchess, having been silent awhile, said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My lord Magnifico, everyone desires to see this lady of yours
well adorned; and if you do not display her to us in such fashion
that all her beauties may be seen, we shall think that you are
jealous of her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lady, if I deemed her beautiful, I should display her all
unadorned and in the same fashion wherein Paris chose to view
the three goddesses;<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c016'><sup>[332]</sup></a> but if these ladies here, who well know
how, do not aid me to deck her forth, I fear that not only my
lord Gaspar and Frisio, but all these other gentlemen, will have
just cause to say ill of her. So, while still she stands in some
repute for beauty, perhaps it will be better to keep her hidden,
and to see what messer Federico has left to say about the Courtier,
which without doubt is far more beautiful than my Lady
can be.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What I had in mind,” replied messer Federico, “is not so
necessary to the Courtier that it may not be omitted without
any harm; nay, it is rather different matter from that which has
thus far been discussed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what is it, then?” said my lady Duchess.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Messer Federico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I had thought of explaining, as far as I could, the origin of
these companies and orders of knighthood established by great
princes under different ensigns: as that of Saint Michael in the
House of France;<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c016'><sup>[333]</sup></a> that of the Garter, which bears the name of
Saint George, in the House of England;<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c016'><sup>[334]</sup></a> the Golden Fleece in
that of Burgundy:<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c016'><sup>[335]</sup></a> and in what manner these dignities are
bestowed, and how they who deserve them are deprived thereof;
whence they arose, who were the founders of them, and to what
end they were established: for even in great courts these knights
are always honoured.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I thought too, if I had time enough, to speak not only of the
diversity of customs that are in use at the courts of Christian
princes in serving them, in merry-making and in appearing at
public shows, but also to say something of the Grand Turk’s<a href='#f252' class='c016'><sup>[252]</sup></a>
court, and much more particularly of the court of the Sophi
king of Persia.<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c016'><sup>[336]</sup></a> For having heard, from merchants who have
been long in that country, that the noblemen there are of great
worth and gentle behaviour, and that in their intercourse with
one another, in their service to ladies and in all their actions,
they practise much courtesy and much discretion, and on occasion
much magnificence, much liberality and elegance in their
weapons, games and festivals,—I was glad to learn what ways
they most prize in these things, and in what their pomp and
finery of dress and arms consist; in what they differ from us, and
in what they resemble us; what manner of amusements their
ladies practise and with what modesty show favour to lovers.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But indeed it is not fitting to enter upon this discussion now,
especially as there is something else to say, and far more to our
purpose than this.”</p>

<p class='c001'>3.—“Nay,” said my lord Gaspar, “both this and many other
things are more to the purpose than to describe this Court Lady;
seeing that the same rules that are set the Courtier, serve also
for the Lady; for she, like the Courtier, ought to have regard to
time and place, and (as far as her stupidity permits) to follow
all those other ways that have been so much discussed. And
therefore, in place of this, perhaps it would not have been amiss
to teach some of the details that pertain to the service of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Prince’s person, for it is well befitting the Courtier to know them
and to show grace in practising them; or indeed to tell of the
method to be pursued in bodily exercises, such as riding, handling
weapons and wrestling, and to tell wherein consists the
difficulty of these accomplishments.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lady Duchess said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Princes do not employ the personal service of so admirable a
Courtier as this: and as for bodily exercises and physical strength
and agility, we will leave to our friend messer Pietro Monte
the duty of teaching them, when he shall deem the season more
convenient; for now the Magnifico must speak of nothing but
this Lady, of whom, methinks, you are already beginning to be
afraid, and so would make us wander from our subject.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Frisio replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Surely it is irrelevant and little to the purpose to speak of
women now, especially when more remains to be said about the
Courtier, for we ought not to mix one thing with another.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are much in errour,” replied messer Cesare Gonzaga;
“for just as no court, however great it be, can have in it adornment
or splendour or gaiety, without ladies, nor can any Courtier
be graceful or pleasing or brave, or perform any gallant feat
of chivalry, unless moved by the society and by the love and
pleasure of ladies: so, too, discussion about the Courtier is always
very imperfect, unless by taking part therein the ladies add their
touch of that grace wherewith they perfect Courtiership and
adorn it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Ottaviano laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“There you have a taste of that bait which makes men fools.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec3.4'></a>4.—Then my lord Magnifico, turning to my lady Duchess, said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Since so it pleases you, my Lady, I will say what occurs to
me, but with very great fear of not satisfying. And in sooth it
would be a far lighter task to describe a lady worthy to be
queen of the world, than a perfect Court Lady: because of the
latter I know not where to take my model; while for the queen
I should not need to go far, and it would be enough for me to
think of the divine accomplishments of a lady whom I know,<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c016'><sup>[337]</sup></a>
and, lost in contemplation, to bend all my thoughts to express
clearly in words that which many see with their eyes; and if I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>could do no more, by merely naming her I should have performed
my task.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lady Duchess said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not wander from your subject, my lord Magnifico, but
hold to the order given you and describe the Court Lady, to the
end that so noble a Lady as this may have someone competent
to serve her worthily.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then, my Lady, to show that your commands have power to
induce me to essay even that which I know not how to do, I will
speak of this excellent Lady as I would have her; and when I
have fashioned her to my liking, not being able then to have
another such, like Pygmalion I will take her for my own.<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c016'><sup>[338]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“And although my lord Gaspar has said that the same rules
which are set the Courtier, serve also for the Lady, I am of
another mind; for while some qualities are common to both and
as necessary to man as to woman, there are nevertheless some
others that befit woman more than man, and some are befitting
man to which she ought to be wholly a stranger. The same I
say of bodily exercises; but above all, methinks that in her ways,
manners, words, gestures and bearing, a woman ought to be
very unlike a man; for just as it befits him to show a certain
stout and sturdy manliness, so it is becoming in a woman to
have a soft and dainty tenderness with an air of womanly sweetness
in her every movement, which, in her going or staying or
saying what you will, shall always make her seem the woman,
without any likeness of a man.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, if this precept be added to the rules that these gentlemen
have taught the Courtier, I certainly think she ought to be
able to profit by many of them, and to adorn herself with admirable
accomplishments, as my lord Gaspar says. For I believe
that many faculties of the mind are as necessary to woman as to
man; likewise gentle birth, to avoid affectation, to be naturally
graceful in all her doings, to be mannerly, clever, prudent, not
arrogant, not envious, not slanderous, not vain, not quarrelsome,
not silly, to know how to win and keep the favour of her
mistress and of all others, to practise well and gracefully the
exercises that befit women. I am quite of the opinion, too, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>beauty is more necessary to her than to the Courtier, for in truth
that woman lacks much who lacks beauty. Then, too, she ought
to be more circumspect and take greater care not to give occasion
for evil being said of her, and so to act that she may not
only escape a stain of guilt but even of suspicion, for a woman
has not so many ways of defending herself against false imputations
as has a man.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But as Count Ludovico has explained very minutely the
chief profession of the Courtier, and has insisted it be that of
arms, methinks it is also fitting to tell what in my judgment is
that of the Court Lady: and when I have done this, I shall think
myself quit of the greater part of my duty.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec3.5'></a>5.—“Laying aside, then, those faculties of the mind that she
ought to have in common with the Courtier (such as prudence,
magnanimity, continence, and many others), and likewise those
qualities that befit all women (such as kindness, discretion, ability
to manage her husband’s property and her house and children
if she be married, and all those capacities that are requisite
in a good housewife), I say that in a lady who lives at court
methinks above all else a certain pleasant affability is befitting,
whereby she may be able to entertain politely every sort of man
with agreeable and seemly converse, suited to the time and
place, and to the rank of the person with whom she may speak,
uniting with calm and modest manners, and with that seemliness
which should ever dispose all her actions, a quick vivacity of
spirit whereby she may show herself alien to all indelicacy; but
with such a kindly manner as shall make us think her no less
chaste, prudent and benign, than agreeable, witty and discreet:
and so she must preserve a certain mean (difficult and composed
almost of contraries), and must barely touch certain limits but
not pass them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus, in her wish to be thought good and pure, the Lady
ought not to be so coy and seem so to abhor company and talk
that are a little free, as to take her leave as soon as she finds
herself therein; for it might easily be thought that she was pretending
to be thus austere in order to hide something about herself
which she feared others might come to know; and such
prudish manners are always odious. Nor ought she, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>other hand, for the sake of showing herself free and agreeable,
to utter unseemly words or practise a certain wild and unbridled
familiarity and ways likely to make that believed of her which
perhaps is not true; but when she is present at such talk, she
ought to listen with a little blush and shame.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Likewise she ought to avoid an errour into which I have
seen many women fall, which is that of saying and of willingly
listening to evil about other women. For those women who, on
hearing the unseemly ways of other women described, grow
angry thereat and seem to disbelieve it and to regard it almost
monstrous that a woman should be immodest,—they, by accounting
the offence so heinous, give reason to think that they do not
commit it. But those who go about continually prying into
other women’s intrigues, and narrate them so minutely and with
such zest, seem to be envious of them and to wish that everyone
may know it, to the end that like matters may not be reckoned
as a fault in their own case; and thus they fall into certain
laughs and ways that show they then feel greatest pleasure.
And hence it comes that men, while seeming to listen gladly,
usually hold such women in small respect and have very little
regard for them, and think these ways of theirs are an invitation
to advance farther, and thus often go such lengths with them as
bring them deserved reproach, and finally esteem them so lightly
as to despise their company and even find them tedious.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And on the other hand, there is no man so shameless and
insolent as not to have reverence for those women who are
esteemed good and virtuous; because this gravity (tempered
with wisdom and goodness) is as it were a shield against the
insolence and coarseness of the presumptuous. Thus we see
that a word or laugh or act of kindness (however small it be)
from a virtuous woman is more prized by everyone, than all the
endearments and caresses of those who show their lack of
shame so openly; and if they are not immodest, by their unseemly
laughter, their loquacity, insolence and like scurrile manners,
they give sign of being so.</p>

<p class='c001'>6.—“And since words that carry no meaning of importance are
vain and puerile, the Court Lady must have not only the good
sense to discern the quality of him with whom she is speaking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>but knowledge of many things, in order to entertain him graciously;
and in her talk she should know how to choose those
things that are adapted to the quality of him with whom she is
speaking, and should be cautious lest occasionally, without
intending it, she utter words that may offend him. Let her
guard against wearying him by praising herself indiscreetly or
by being too prolix. Let her not go about mingling serious
matters with her playful or humourous discourse, or jests and
jokes with her serious discourse. Let her not stupidly pretend
to know that which she does not know, but modestly seek to
do herself credit in that which she does know,—in all things
avoiding affectation, as has been said. In this way she will be
adorned with good manners, and will perform with perfect grace
the bodily exercises proper to women; her discourse will be
rich and full of prudence, virtue and pleasantness; and thus she
will be not only loved but revered by everyone, and perhaps
worthy to be placed side by side with this great Courtier as well
in qualities of the mind as in those of the body.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec3.7'></a>7.—Having so far spoken, the Magnifico was silent and sat
quiet, as if he had ended his discourse. Then my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Verily, my lord Magnifico, you have adorned this Lady well
and given her excellent qualities. Yet methinks you have kept
much to generalities, and mentioned some things in her so
great that I think you were ashamed to explain them, and have
rather desired than taught them, after the manner of those
who sometimes wish for things impossible and beyond nature.
Therefore I would have you declare to us a little better what
are the bodily exercises proper to a Court Lady, and in what
way she ought to converse, and what those many things are
whereof you say it befits her to have knowledge; and whether
you mean that she should use the prudence, the magnanimity,
the continence, and the many other virtues you have named,
merely to aid her in the government of her house, children and
family (which however you would not have her chief profession),
or indeed in her conversation and graceful practice of those
bodily exercises; and, by your faith, guard against setting these
poor virtues to such menial duty that they must needs be ashamed
of it.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>The Magnifico laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My lord Gaspar, you cannot help showing your ill will towards
women. But in truth I thought I had said enough, and
especially before such hearers; for I am quite sure there is no
one here who does not perceive that in the matter of bodily
exercises it does not befit women to handle weapons, to ride, to
play tennis, to wrestle, and to do many other things that befit
men.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the Unico Aretino said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Among the ancients it was the custom for women to wrestle
unclothed with men; but we have lost this good custom, along
with many others.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Cesare Gonzaga added:</p>

<p class='c001'>“And in my time I have seen women play tennis, handle weapons,
ride, go hunting, and perform nearly all the exercises that
a cavalier can.”</p>

<p class='c001'>8.—The Magnifico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Since I may fashion this Lady as I wish, not only am I unwilling
to have her practise such vigourous and rugged manly
exercises, but I would have her practise even those that are becoming
to women, circumspectly and with that gentle daintiness
which we have said befits her; and thus in dancing I would not
see her use too active and violent movements, nor in singing or
playing those abrupt and oft-repeated diminutions which show
more skill than sweetness; likewise the musical instruments
that she uses ought, in my opinion, to be appropriate to this intent.
Imagine how unlovely it would be to see a woman play
drums, fifes or trumpets, or other like instruments; and this because
their harshness hides and destroys that mild gentleness
which so much adorns every act a woman does. Therefore
when she starts to dance or make music of any kind, she ought
to bring herself to it by letting herself be urged a little, and with
a touch of shyness which shall show that noble shame which is
the opposite of effrontery.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Moreover, she ought to adapt her dress to this intent, and so
to clothe herself that she may not seem vain or frivolous. But
since women may and ought to take more care for beauty than
men,—and there are divers sorts of beauty,—this Lady ought to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>have the good sense to discern what those garments are that
enhance her grace and are most appropriate to the exercises
wherein she purposes to engage at the time, and to wear them.
And if she is conscious of possessing a bright and cheerful
beauty, she ought to set it off with movements, words and dress
all tending towards the cheerful; so too, another, who feels that
her style is gentle and serious, ought to accompany it with fashions
of that sort, in order to enhance that which is the gift of
nature. Thus, if she is a little more stout or thin than the medium,
or fair or dark, let her seek help from dress, but as covertly
as possible; and while keeping herself dainty and neat,
let her always seem to give no thought or heed to it.</p>

<p class='c001'>9.—“And since my lord Gaspar further asks what these many
things are whereof she ought to have knowledge, and in what
manner she ought to converse, and whether her virtues ought
to contribute to her conversation,—I say I would have her acquainted
with that which these gentlemen wished the Courtier
to know. And of the exercises that we have said do not befit
her, I would have her at least possess such understanding as we
may have of things that we do not practise; and this in order
that she may know how to praise and value cavaliers more or
less, according to their deserts.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And to repeat in a few words part of what has been already
said, I wish this Lady to have knowledge of letters, music, painting,
and to know how to dance and make merry; accompanying
the other precepts that have been taught the Courtier with discreet
modesty and with the giving of a good impression of herself.
And thus, in her talk, her laughter, her play, her jesting,
in short, in everything, she will be very graceful, and will entertain
appropriately, and with witticisms and pleasantries befitting
her, everyone who shall come before her. And although continence,
magnanimity, temperance, strength of mind, prudence,
and the other virtues, seem to have little to do with entertainment,
I would have her adorned with all of them, not so much
for the sake of entertainment (albeit even there they can be
of service), as in order that she may be full of virtue, and to
the end that these virtues may render her worthy of being
honoured, and that her every act may be governed by them.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span><a id='sec3.10'></a>10.—My lord Gaspar then said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Since you have given women letters and continence and
magnanimity and temperance, I only marvel that you would
not also have them govern cities, make laws, and lead armies,
and let the men stay at home to cook or spin.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico replied, also laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perhaps even this would not be amiss.” Then he added:
“Do you not know that Plato, who certainly was no great friend
to women, gave them charge over the city, and gave all other
martial duties to the men?<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c016'><sup>[339]</sup></a> Do you not believe that there are
many to be found who would know how to govern cities and
armies as well as men do? But I have not laid these duties on
them, because I am fashioning a Court Lady and not a Queen.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I well know you would like to repeat tacitly that false imputation
which my lord Ottaviano cast on women yesterday:
namely, that they are very imperfect creatures, incapable of
doing any good act, and of very little worth and no dignity by
comparison with men: but in truth both he and you would be
greatly in the wrong if you were to think this.”</p>

<p class='c001'>11.—Then my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not wish to repeat things already said; but you would
fain lead me to say something to offend these ladies’ feelings in
order to make them my enemies, just as you wish to win their
favour by flattering them falsely. But they are so much above
other women in discretion that they love truth (even if it be little
in their favour) more than false praises; nor do they take it
amiss if anyone says that men are of greater dignity, and will
admit that you have recounted great miracles and ascribed to
the Court Lady certain absurd impossibilities, and so many virtues
that Socrates and Cato and all the philosophers in the world
are as nothing by comparison. To tell the plain truth, I marvel
that you were not ashamed to go so far beyond bounds; for it
ought to have been quite enough for you to make this Court
Lady beautiful, discreet, chaste, gracious, and able (without
incurring infamy) to entertain with dancing, music, games,
laughter, witticisms, and the other things which we see used at
court every day. But to insist on giving her knowledge of all
the things in the world, and to attribute to her those virtues that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>are so rarely seen in men even in past centuries, is something
that cannot be endured or hardly listened to.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, I am far from willing to affirm that women are imperfect
creatures, and consequently of less dignity than men, and
not capable of those virtues that men are,—because these ladies’
worth would suffice to prove me wrong:<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c016'><sup>[340]</sup></a> but I do say that very
learned men have left it in writing that since nature always aims
and designs to make things most perfect, she would continually
bring forth men if she could; and when a woman is born, it is a
defect or mistake of nature, and contrary to that which she
would wish to do: as is seen also in the case of one who is born
blind or halt or with some other defect; and in trees, many
fruits that never ripen. Thus woman may be said to be a creature
produced by chance and accident; and that this is so, mark
a man’s acts and a woman’s, and judge therefrom the perfection
of both. Yet, as these imperfections of women are the fault of nature
who has made them so, we ought not on that account to hate
them or fail to show them that respect which is their due. But
to esteem them above what they are, seems to me plain errour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>12.—The Magnifico Giuliano waited for my lord Gaspar to continue
further, but seeing that he kept silent, said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“As to women’s imperfection, methinks you have adduced a
very weak argument; to which, although perhaps it be not
timely to enter upon these subtleties now, I reply (according to
the opinion of one who knows and according to truth) that the
substance of anything you please cannot receive into itself more
or less. For just as no one stone can be more perfectly stone
than another as regards the essence of a stone, nor one piece of
wood more perfectly wood than another,—so one man cannot
be more perfectly man than another; and consequently the male
will not be more perfect than the female as regards its essential
substance, because both are included in the species man, and
that wherein the one differs from the other is an accidental matter
and not essential. In case you then tell me that man is more
perfect than woman, if not in essence, at least in non-essentials,
I reply that these non-essentials must pertain either to the body
or to the mind; if to the body (as in that man is more robust,
more agile, lighter, or more capable of toil), I say that this is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>proof of very slight perfection, because even among men, they
who have these qualities more than others have, are not more
esteemed therefor; and even in wars, where the greater part of
the work is laborious and a matter of strength, the strongest are
yet not the most prized; if to the mind, I say that all the things
that men can understand, the same can women understand too;
and where the intellect of the one penetrates, there also can that
of the other penetrate.”</p>

<p class='c001'>13.—Having here made a little pause, the Magnifico Giuliano
added, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you not know that in philosophy this proposition is maintained,
that those who are tender in flesh are apt in mind? So
there is no doubt that women, being tenderer in flesh, are apter
in mind, and of capacity better fitted for speculation than men
are.” Then he continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“But leaving this aside, since you have told me to argue concerning
the perfection of both from their acts, I say that if you
will consider the workings of nature, you will find that she
makes women what they are, not by chance, but adapted to the
necessary end: for although she makes them not strong in body
and of placid spirit, with many other qualities opposed to those
of men, yet the characters of both tend to one single end conducive
to the same use. For just as by reason of that feebleness
of theirs women are less courageous, so for the same reason they
are also more cautious: thus the mother nourishes her children,
the father instructs them and with his strength earns abroad
that which she with anxious care preserves at home, which is
not the lesser merit.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Again, if you examine the ancient histories (albeit men have
ever been very chary of writing women’s praises) and the modern
ones, you will find that worth has continually existed among
women as well as among men; and that there have even been
those who waged wars and won glorious victories therein, governed
kingdoms with the highest prudence and justice, and did
everything that men have done. As for the sciences, do you
not remember having read of many women who were learned
in philosophy? Others who were very excellent in poetry?
Others who conducted suits, and accused and defended most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>eloquently before judges? Of handicrafts it would be too long
to tell, nor is there need to bring proof regarding that.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore, if in essential substance man is not more perfect
than woman, nor in non-essentials either (and of this, quite
apart from argument, the effects are seen), I do not know in
what consists this perfection of his.</p>

<p class='c001'>14.—“And since you said that nature’s aim is always to bring
forth the most perfect things, and that she therefore would
always bring forth man if she could, and that the bringing forth
of woman is rather an errour or defect in nature than of purpose,—I
reply that this is totally denied; nor do I see how you
can say that nature does not aim to bring forth women, without
whom the human species cannot be preserved, whereof this
same nature is more desirous than of everything else. For by
means of this union of male and female she brings forth children,
who repay the benefits received in childhood by maintaining
their parents when old; then in turn they beget other children
of their own, from whom they look to receive in old age
that which they in their youth bestowed upon their parents;
thus nature, moving as it were in a circle, fills out eternity and
in this way grants immortality to mortals. Woman being
therefore as necessary in this as man, I do not see how the
one was made more by chance than the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is very true that nature aims always to bring forth the
most perfect things, and hence means to bring forth man after
his kind, but not male rather than female. Nay, if she were
always to bring forth male, she would be working imperfection;
for just as from body and soul there results a compound more
noble than its parts, which is man,—so from the union of male
and female there results a compound which preserves the
human species, and without which its members would perish.
And hence male and female are by nature always together, nor
can the one exist without the other; thus that ought not to be
called male which has no female, according to the definition of
each; nor female, that which has no male. And as one sex
alone shows imperfection, the theologians of old attribute both
the one and the other to God:<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c016'><sup>[341]</sup></a> wherefore Orpheus said that
Jove was male and female; and we read in Holy Writ that God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>formed men male and female in his own likeness; and often the
poets, speaking of the gods, confuse the sex.”</p>

<p class='c001'>15.—Then my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I would not have us enter upon such subtleties, because
these ladies will not understand us, and although I answer you
with excellent arguments, they will believe (or at least pretend
to believe) that I am wrong, and straightway will pronounce
judgment to their liking. Yet since we are already begun, I
will say merely this, that (as you know is the opinion of very
wise men) man resembles form, and woman matter; and therefore,
just as form is more perfect than matter,—nay, gives it its
being,—so man is far more perfect than woman. And I remember
having once heard that a great philosopher says in some of
his problems:<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c016'><sup>[342]</sup></a> ‘Why is it that a woman always naturally loves
the man who first tasted the sweets of love with her? and on
the contrary a man holds that woman in hatred who was the
first to give herself to him?’ And adding the reason, he affirms
it to be this: because in this matter the woman receives perfection
from the man, and the man imperfection from the woman;
and therefore everyone naturally loves that thing which makes
him perfect, and hates that which makes him imperfect. And
besides this, a great argument for the perfection of man and for
the imperfection of woman is that every woman universally
desires to be a man, by a certain natural instinct that teaches
her to desire her perfection.”</p>

<p class='c001'>16.—The Magnifico Giuliano at once replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“The poor creatures do not desire to be men in order to be
perfect, but in order to have liberty and to escape that dominion
over them which man has arrogated to himself by his own
authority. And the analogy that you cite of matter and form
does not apply in everything; for woman is not made perfect by
man, as matter by form: because matter receives its being from
form and cannot exist without it; nay, the more matter forms
have, the more they have of imperfection, and are most perfect
when separated from it. But woman does not receive her being
from man; nay, just as she is made perfect by him, she also
makes him perfect. Hence both join in procreation, which
neither of them can effect without the other.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>“Therefore I will assign the cause of woman’s lasting love
for the first man to whom she has given herself, and of man’s
hatred for the first woman, not at all to that which your Philosopher
alleges in his problems, but to woman’s firmness and constancy,
and to man’s inconstancy; nor without natural reason:
for being warm, the male naturally derives from that quality
lightness, movement and inconstancy, while from her frigidity
woman on the other hand derives quietness, firm gravity, and
more fixed impressions.”</p>

<p class='c001'>17.—Then my lady Emilia turned to my lord Magnifico and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“For the love of Heaven, leave these matters and forms of
yours awhile, and male and female, and speak in such fashion
that you may be understood; for we heard and understood very
well the evil that my lord Ottaviano and my lord Gaspar said of
us, but now we do not at all understand in what manner you are
defending us: so it seems to me that you are straying from the
subject and leaving in everyone’s mind that bad impression
which these enemies of ours have given of us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not give us that name, my Lady,” replied my lord Gaspar,
“for it better befits my lord Magnifico, who by bestowing false
praises upon women shows that there are none true of them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico Giuliano continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not doubt, my Lady, that answer will be made to everything.
But I do not wish to utter such inordinate abuse of men
as they have uttered of women; and if by chance there were
anyone to write down our discussions, I should not like, in a
place where these matters and forms are understood, to have
the arguments and reasons that my lord Gaspar adduces against
you, appear to have been without reply.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not see, my lord Magnifico,” my lord Gaspar then said,
“how in this matter you will be able to deny that man is by his
natural qualities more perfect than woman, who is frigid by
temperament, and man warm. And warmth is far nobler and
more perfect than cold, because it is active and productive; and,
as you know, the heavens send down only warmth upon us here,
and not cold, which does not enter into the works of nature.
And hence I believe that the frigidity of women’s temperament
is the cause of their abasement and timidity.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>18.—“So you too,” replied the Magnifico Giuliano, “wish to
enter into subtleties; but you shall see that you will always have
the worst of it: and that this is true, listen.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I grant you that warmth is in itself more perfect than cold;
but this is not the case with things mixed and composite; for if
it were so, that body which is warmer would be more perfect,
which is false, because temperate bodies are most perfect.
Moreover, I tell you that woman is of frigid temperament by
comparison with man, who by excess of warmth is far from temperate;
but as for her, she is temperate (or at least more nearly
temperate than man is) because she has in her a moisture proportioned
to her natural warmth, which in man usually evaporates
by reason of excessive dryness and is consumed. Furthermore,
her coldness is of the kind that resists and moderates her
natural warmth and makes it more nearly temperate; while in
man the surplus warmth soon raises his natural heat to the
highest pitch, which wastes away for lack of sustenance. And
thus, as men lose more in procreation than women do, it often
happens that they are less long lived than women; wherefore
this perfection also may be ascribed to women, that, living longer
than men, they perform better than men that which is the intent
of nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of the warmth that the heavens shed upon us I do not speak
now, because it is of a different sort from that which we are discussing;
for being preservative of all things under the moon’s
orb, warm as well as cold, it cannot be hostile to cold. But timidity
in women, although it shows some imperfection, yet springs
from a praiseworthy source, that is, from the subtlety and readiness
of their wits, which picture images to their minds quickly
and thus are easily disturbed by things external. You will very
often see men who fear neither death nor anything else, and yet
cannot be called courageous, because they do not know the danger
and go like fools where they see the road open, and think no
further; and this proceeds from a certain grossness of dull wits:
wherefore we cannot say that a fool is brave. But true loftiness
of mind comes from a due deliberation and determined resolve
to act thus and so, and from esteeming honour and duty above
all the dangers in the world; and from being of such stout heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>and courage (although death be manifest), that the senses are
not clogged or frightened, but perform their office in speech and
thought as if they were most quiet. We have seen and heard
that great men are of this sort; likewise many women, who both
in ancient and in modern times have displayed greatness of
spirit and have wrought upon the world effects worthy of infinite
praise, not less than men have done.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec3.19'></a>19.—Then Frisio said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“These effects began when the first woman by her transgression
led others to transgress against God, and left the human
race an heritage of death, sufferings, sorrows, and all the miseries
and calamities that are felt in the world to-day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico Giuliano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Since you too are pleased to enter upon sacred things, do
you not know that this transgression was repaired by a Woman,
who brought us much greater gain than the other had done us
injury, so that the guilt is called most fortunate which was
atoned by such merits? But I do not now mean to tell you how
inferior in dignity all human creatures are to our Lady the
Virgin (in order not to mingle things divine with these light discussions
of ours); nor to recount how many women have, with
infinite constancy, suffered themselves to be cruelly slain by
tyrants for Christ’s name, nor those who by learned disputation
have confuted so many idolaters. And if you told me that this
was a miracle and grace of the Holy Spirit, I say that no virtue
merits more praise than that which is approved by the testimony
of God. Many other women also, of whom there is less
talk, you yourself can see,—especially by reading Saint Jerome,
who celebrates certain ones of his time with such admiring
praises as might well suffice for the saintliest man on earth.<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c016'><sup>[343]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>20.—“Then consider how many others there have been, of
whom no mention is made at all, because the poor creatures are
kept shut up, without the lofty pride to seek the name of saint
from the rabble, as many accursed hypocrites do to-day, who,—forgetful
or rather regardless of Christ’s teaching, which requires
that when a man fasts he shall anoint his face in order that he
may not seem to fast, and commands that prayers, alms, and
other good works shall be done, not in the market-place nor in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>synagogues, but in secret, so that the left hand shall not know of
the right,—affirm that there is no greater good thing in the
world than to give a good example: and so, with averted head
and downcast eyes, noising it abroad that they will not speak to
women or eat anything but raw herbs,—dirty, with cassocks
torn, they beguile the simple. Yet they abstain not from forging
wills, setting mortal enmities between man and wife, and sometimes
poison, using sorceries, incantations and every sort of
villainy. And then they cite a certain authority out of their own
head, which says, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>si non caste, tamen caute</i></span>;<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c016'><sup>[344]</sup></a> and with this they
think to cure every great evil, and with good arguments to persuade
anyone who is not right wary that all sin, however grave
it be, is easily pardoned of God, provided it remain secret and do
not give rise to bad example. Thus, under a veil of sanctity and
in secret they often turn all their thoughts to corrupt the pure
mind of some woman; often to sow hatred between brothers;
to govern states; to raise up one and cast another down; to get
men beheaded, imprisoned and proscribed; to be ministers of
the villainies and as it were receivers of the thefts that many
princes commit.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Others shamelessly delight to appear dainty and fresh, with
well-shaven crown and garments fine, and in walking lift the
cassock to display their neat hose and their comeliness of person
in making salutations. Others use certain glances and gestures
even in saying mass, whereby they imagine they are graceful
and attract attention. Villainous and wicked men, utter strangers
not only to religion but to all good behaviour; and when
they are reproved for their loose living, they make a jest of it
and laugh at him who speaks to them of it, and almost make a
merit of their vices.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lady Emilia said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You take such pleasure in speaking ill of friars, that you have
entered upon this subject without rhyme or reason. But you
are very wrong to murmur against ecclesiastics, and you burden
your conscience quite needlessly; since, but for those who pray
to God for us, we should have much greater scourges than we
have.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the Magnifico Giuliano laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>“How did you guess so well, my Lady, that I was speaking of
friars, when I did not name them? But in truth what I do is not
called murmuring, for I speak very openly and plainly; nor am
I speaking of the good, but of the bad and guilty, of whom moreover
I do not tell the thousandth part of what I know.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not speak of friars now,” replied my lady Emilia; “because
for my part I esteem it grievous sin to listen to you, and so
I shall go away in order not to listen to you.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec3.21'></a>21.—“I am content,” said the Magnifico Giuliano, “to speak no
more of this; but returning to the praises of women, I say that
my lord Gaspar shall not find me an admirable man, but I will
find you a wife or daughter or sister of equal and sometimes
greater merit. Moreover, many women have been the cause of
countless benefits to their men-folk, and sometimes have corrected
many a one of his errours. Wherefore, women being (as
we have shown) naturally capable of the same virtues as men,
and the effects thereof being often seen, I do not perceive why,—in
giving them what it is possible for them to have, what they
more than once have had and still have,—I should be regarded
as relating miracles, whereof my lord Gaspar has accused me;
seeing that there have always been on earth, and now still are,
women as like the Court Lady I have fashioned, as men like the
man these gentlemen have fashioned.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Those arguments that have experience against them do not
seem to me good; and certainly if I were to ask you who these
great women were that have been as worthy of praise as the
great men whose wives or sisters or daughters they were, or
that have been the cause of any benefit, and who those were
that have corrected the errours of their men-folk,—I think you
would be embarrassed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>22.—“Verily,” replied the Magnifico Giuliano, “no other thing
could make me embarrassed save their multitude; and had I
time enough, I should tell you here the story of Octavia,<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c016'><sup>[345]</sup></a> wife
of Mark Antony and sister of Augustus; that of Porcia,<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c016'><sup>[346]</sup></a> Cato’s
daughter and wife of Brutus; that of Caia Cæcilia,<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c016'><sup>[347]</sup></a> wife of Tarquinius
Priscus; that of Cornelia,<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c016'><sup>[348]</sup></a> Scipio’s daughter; and of
countless others who are very celebrated: and not only of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>own, but of barbarian nations; as that of Alexandra,<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c016'><sup>[349]</sup></a> wife of
Alexander king of the Jews, who,—after her husband’s death,
when she saw the people kindled with fury and already up in
arms to slay the two children that he had left her, in revenge for
the cruel and grievous bondage in which the father had always
kept them,—so acted that she soon appeased their just wrath,
and by her prudence straightway won over for her children
those minds which the father, by countless injuries during many
years, had made very hostile to his offspring.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“At least tell us,” replied my lady Emilia, “how she did it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Seeing her children in such peril,” said the Magnifico, “she
at once caused Alexander’s body to be cast into the middle of
the market-place. Then, having called the citizens to her, she
said that she knew their minds to be kindled with very just
wrath against her husband, because the cruel injuries that
he had iniquitously done them deserved it; and that, as she had
always wished, while he was alive, that she could make him
abstain from such a wicked life, so now she was ready to give
proof of it, and as far as possible to help them punish him after
death; and therefore let them take his body, and give it as food
for dogs, and outrage it in the most cruel ways they could
devise: but she prayed them to have mercy upon her innocent
children, who could not have either guilt or even knowledge of
the father’s evil deeds. Of such efficacy were these words,
that the fierce wrath before conceived in the minds of all that
people was quickly softened and turned to a feeling of such pity,
that they not only with one accord chose the children for their
rulers, but also gave most honourable burial to the body of the
dead.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here the Magnifico made a little pause; then he added:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you not know that the wife and daughters of Mithridates
showed much less fear of death than Mithridates?<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c016'><sup>[350]</sup></a> And Hasdrubal’s
wife than Hasdrubal?<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c016'><sup>[351]</sup></a> Do you not know that Harmonia,
daughter of Hiero the Syracusan, chose to perish in the
burning of her native city?”<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c016'><sup>[352]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Then Frisio said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Where obstinacy is concerned, it is certain that some women
are occasionally to be found who never change their purpose;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>like the one who being no longer able to say ‘Scissors’ to her
husband, made the sign of them to him with her hands.”<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c016'><sup>[353]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>23.—The Magnifico Giuliano laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Obstinacy that tends to a worthy end ought to be called
steadfastness; as was the case of the famous Epicharis, a Roman
freedwoman, who, being privy to a great conspiracy against Nero,
was of such steadfastness that, although racked by all the direst
tortures that can be imagined, she never betrayed one of her
accomplices; while in the same peril many noble knights and
senators basely accused brothers, friends and the dearest and
nearest they had in the world.<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c016'><sup>[354]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“What will you say of that other woman who was called
Leæna? In whose honour the Athenians dedicated a tongueless
lioness (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>leæna</i></span>) in bronze before the gate of the citadel, to
show in her the steadfast virtue of silence; because being likewise
privy to a conspiracy against the tyrants, she was not dismayed
by the death of two great men (her friends), and although
rent by countless most cruel tortures, she never betrayed one of
the conspirators.”<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c016'><sup>[355]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Then madonna Margarita Gonzaga said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Methinks you narrate too briefly these virtuous deeds done
by women; for these enemies of ours, although having heard
and read them, yet pretend not to know them and fain would
have the memory of them lost: but if you will let us women hear
them, we at least shall deem ourselves honoured by them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>24.—Then the Magnifico Giuliano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“So be it. I wish to tell you now of one who did what I think
my lord Gaspar himself will admit very few men do;” and he
began: “In Massilia<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c016'><sup>[356]</sup></a> there was once a custom that is believed
to have been brought from Greece, which was that they publicly<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c016'><sup>[357]</sup></a>
kept a poison compounded of hemlock, and allowed anyone
to take it who proved to the Senate that he ought to lay
down his life because of any trouble that he found therein, or for
other just cause, to the end that whoever had suffered a too hostile
fortune or had enjoyed a too prosperous fortune, should not
drag on the one or change the other. Now Sextus Pompey,
finding himself—”<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c016'><sup>[358]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Here Frisio, not waiting for the Magnifico Giuliano to go on, said:</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>“Methinks this is the beginning of a long story.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the Magnifico Giuliano turned to madonna Margarita
laughing, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You see that Frisio will not let me speak. I wished to tell
you now about a woman who, having shown to the Senate that
she had good reason to die, cheerfully and fearlessly took the
poison in Sextus Pompey’s presence, with such steadfastness of
spirit and with such affectionate and thoughtful remembrances
to her family, that Pompey and all the others who saw such wisdom
and confidence on a woman’s part in the dread hour of
death, were lost in wonderment and tears.”</p>

<p class='c001'>25.—Then my lord Gaspar said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I too remember having read a speech in which an unhappy
husband asks leave of the Senate to die, and proves that he has
just cause for it in that he cannot endure the continual annoyance
of his wife’s chatter, and prefers to drink the poison, which
you say was publicly kept for such purposes, than his wife’s
words.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico Giuliano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“How many poor women would have just cause for asking
leave to die because they cannot endure, I will not say the evil
words, but the very evil deeds of their husbands! I know several
such, who suffer in this world the pains that are said to be
in hell.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you not believe,” replied my lord Gaspar, “that there are
also many husbands who have such torment of their wives that
they hourly wish for death?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what pain,” said the Magnifico, “can wives give their
husbands that is as incurable as are those that husbands give
their wives?—who if not for love, at least for fear, are submissive
to their husbands.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certain it is,” said my lord Gaspar, “that the little good they
sometimes do proceeds from fear, since there are few in the
world who in their secret hearts do not hate their husbands.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, quite the contrary,” replied the Magnifico; “and if you
recall aright what you have read, we see in all the histories that
wives nearly always love their husbands more than husbands
love their wives. When did you ever see or read of a husband
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>showing his wife such a token of love as did the famous Camma
to her husband?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not know,” replied my lord Gaspar, “who the woman
was, nor what token she showed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nor I,” said Frisio.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Listen,” replied the Magnifico; “and do you, madonna Margarita,
take care to keep it in mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>26.—“This Camma was a very beautiful young woman, adorned
with such modesty and gentle manners that she was admirable
no less for this than for her beauty; and above other things with
all her heart she loved her husband, who was called Synattus.
It happened that another gentleman, who was of much higher
station than Synattus and almost tyrant of the city where they
lived, became enamoured of this young woman; and after having
long tried by every way and means to possess her, and all in
vain, he persuaded himself that the love she bore her husband
was the sole cause that hindered his desires, and had this Synattus
slain.</p>

<p class='c001'>“So then urging her continually, he was never able to gain
other advantage than he had done at first; wherefore, his love
increasing daily, he resolved to take her for his wife, although
she was far beneath him in station. So, her parents being asked
by Sinoris (for thus the lover was called), they began to persuade
her to accept him, showing her that her consent would be
very advantageous, and her refusal dangerous to her and to
them all. After resisting them awhile, she at last replied that
she was willing.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Her parents had the news brought to Sinoris, who was
happy beyond measure and arranged that the marriage should
be celebrated at once. Both having accordingly come in state
for the purpose to the temple of Diana, Camma had a certain
sweet drink brought which she had prepared; and so before
Diana’s image she drank half of it in the presence of Sinoris;
then with her own hand (for thus it was the custom to do at
marriages) she gave the rest to her spouse, who drank it all.</p>

<p class='c001'>“When Camma saw that her plan had succeeded, she knelt
all joyful at the foot of Diana’s image, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘O Goddess, thou who knowest the secrets of my heart, be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>thou sure witness for me how hardly I refrained from putting
myself to death after my dear consort died, and with what weariness
I bore the sorrow of remaining in this bitter life, wherein
I felt no other good or pleasure beyond the hope of that vengeance
which now I find I have attained. Joyful and content,
then, I go to seek the sweet company of that soul which in life
and in death I have loved more than myself. And thou, wretch,
who thoughtest to be my husband, instead of the marriage bed
give order that thy tomb be made ready for thee, for I offer thee
as a sacrifice to the shade of Synattus.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“Aghast at these words, and already feeling the effect of the
poison stir pain within him, Sinoris tried many remedies; but
they were of no avail, and Camma had such great good fortune
(or whatever else it was), that before dying herself she knew that
Sinoris was dead. Learning which thing, she very contentedly
laid herself upon her bed with eyes to heaven, continually calling
the name of Synattus, and saying:</p>

<p class='c001'>“‘O sweetest consort, now that I have given both tears and
vengeance as last offerings for thy death, nor see that aught else
is left me to do for thee, I hasten from the world and this life,—cruel
without thee and once dear to me only for thy sake. Come
then to meet me, my Lord, and receive this soul as gladly as it
gladly comes to thee.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“And speaking thus, and with arms opened as if she would
already embrace him, she died. Now say, Frisio, what do you
think of her?”<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c016'><sup>[359]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Frisio replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think you fain would make these ladies weep. But even
supposing this were true, I tell you that such women are no
longer to be found in the world.”</p>

<p class='c001'>27.—“Indeed they are to be found,” said the Magnifico; “and
that this is true, listen:</p>

<p class='c001'>“In my time there was a gentleman at Pisa, whose name was
messer Tommaso; I do not remember of what family, although
I often heard it mentioned by my father, who was a great friend
of his. Now this messer Tommaso, crossing one day in a small
vessel from Pisa to Sicily on business, was surprised by some
Moorish galleys which had come up so stealthily that those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>commanded the vessel did not suspect it; and although the men
who were in her defended themselves stoutly, yet as they were
few and the enemy many, the vessel fell into the hands of the
Moors, together with all who were in her, both wounded and
whole as it chanced, and among them messer Tommaso, who
had carried himself bravely and slain with his own hand a
brother of one of the captains of the galleys. Wherefore enraged,
as you may believe, by the loss of a brother, the captain
claimed him as special prisoner, and beating and maltreating
him every day, carried him to Barbary, having resolved to keep
him there in great misery a captive for life and with grievous
pains.</p>

<p class='c001'>“All the others got free after a time, some in one way and
some in another, and returned home and reported to his wife
(whose name was madonna Argentina) and to his children, the
hard life and sore affliction in which messer Tommaso was
living and was like to go on living without hope unless God
should aid him miraculously. After she and they were informed
of this and had tried several other means to deliver him, and
when he himself was quite resigned to die, it came to pass that
watchful love so kindled the wit and daring of one of his sons,
who was called Paolo, that the youth took no heed of any kind
of danger and resolved either to die or to free his father; and
this thing was brought about in such sort that the father was
conveyed away so privily that he was in Leghorn before it was
discovered in Barbary that he had departed thence. From here
messer Tommaso wrote in safety to his wife, and informed her
of his deliverance and where he was and how he hoped to see
her the next day. Overwhelmed with great and unexpected joy
at being (through the dutifulness and merit of her son) so soon
to see her husband, whom she so dearly loved and firmly believed
she would never see again,—the good and gentle lady raised her
eyes to heaven when she had read the letter, and calling her
husband’s name fell dead upon the ground; nor in spite of all the
remedies that were employed upon her did the departed spirit
return again to her body. Cruel spectacle, and enough to moderate
human wishes and restrain their over-longing for too
much joy.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span><a id='sec3.28'></a>28.—Then Frisio said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“How do you know that she did not die of grief at hearing that
her husband was coming home?”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because the rest of her life did not comport with this; nay, I
think that her soul, unable to brook delay in seeing him with the
eyes of her body, forsook it, and, drawn by eagerness, quickly
flew whither her thought had flown on reading the letter.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It may be that this lady was too loving, for women always
run to extremes in everything, which is bad; and you see that by
being too loving she wrought evil to herself, and to her husband
and children, for whom she turned to bitterness the joy of his
perilous and longed-for deliverance. So you ought by no means
to cite her as one of those women who have been the cause of
such great benefits.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I cite her as one of those who bear witness that there are
wives who love their husbands; for of those who have been the
cause of great benefits to the world, I could tell you of an endless
number, and discourse to you of some so ancient that they almost
seem fabulous, and of those who among men have been the
inventors of such things, that they deserved to be esteemed as
goddesses, like Pallas and Ceres; and of the Sibyls,<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c016'><sup>[360]</sup></a> by whose
mouth God has so often spoken and revealed to the world events
that were to come; and of those who have instructed very great
men, like Aspasia,<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c016'><sup>[361]</sup></a> and like Diotima,<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c016'><sup>[362]</sup></a> who furthermore by her
sacrifices delayed for ten years the time of a pestilence that was
to come upon Athens. I could tell you of Nicostrate,<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c016'><sup>[363]</sup></a> Evander’s
mother, who taught the Latins letters; and of still another
woman,<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c016'><sup>[364]</sup></a> who was preceptress to the lyric poet Pindar;<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c016'><sup>[365]</sup></a> and of
Corinna<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c016'><sup>[366]</sup></a> and of Sappho,<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c016'><sup>[367]</sup></a> who were excellent in poetry; but I
do not wish to seek out matters so far afield. I tell you, however
(leaving the rest apart), that women were perhaps not less the
cause of Rome’s greatness than men.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“This,” said my lord Gaspar, “would be fine to hear.”</p>

<p class='c001'>29.—The Magnifico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then listen to it. After the fall of Troy many Trojans fled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>who escaped that great disaster, some in one direction and some
in another; of whom one part, who were buffeted by many
storms, came to Italy at that place where the Tiber flows into
the sea. Landing here in search of necessaries, they began to
roam about the country: the women, who had remained in the
ships, bethought themselves of a good plan that would put an
end to their perilous and long wandering by sea and give them
a new fatherland in place of that which they had lost; and after
consulting together in the absence of the men, they burned the
ships; and the first to begin the work bore the name Roma. Yet
fearing the wrath of the men, who were returning, they went
out to meet these; and embracing and kissing, some their
husbands, some their kinsmen, with tokens of affection, they
softened the first impulse of anger; then they quietly explained
to the men the reason of their wise device. Whereupon the
Trojans, either from necessity or from having been kindly received
by the natives, were well pleased with what the women
had done, and dwelt there with the Latins in the place where
afterwards was Rome; and from this arose the ancient custom
among the Romans that the women kissed their kinsfolk when
they met.<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c016'><sup>[368]</sup></a> Now you see how much these women helped to
make a beginning of Rome.</p>

<p class='c001'>30.—“Nor did the Sabine women contribute less to its increase
than the Trojan women did to its beginning. For Romulus,
having excited general enmity among all his neighbours by the
seizure of their women, was harassed by wars on every side;
which (he being a man of ability) were soon brought to a successful
issue, except that with the Sabines, which was very great
because Titus Tatius, king of the Sabines, was very powerful and
wise. Wherefore, a severe conflict having taken place between
Romans and Sabines, with very heavy loss on both sides, and a
new and cruel battle making ready, the Sabine women,—clad in
black, with hair loose and torn, weeping, sorrowful, fearless of
the weapons that were already drawn to strike,—rushed in
between the fathers and husbands, imploring them to refrain
from defiling their hands with the blood of fathers-in-law and
sons-in-law. And if the men were still displeased with the alliance,
let the weapons be turned against the women, for it were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>better for them to die than to live widowed or fatherless and
brotherless, and to remember that their children were begotten
of those who had slain their fathers, or that they themselves
were born of those who had slain their husbands. Lamenting
thus and weeping, many of them carried their little babes in their
arms,<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c016'><sup>[369]</sup></a> some of whom were already beginning to loose the
tongue and seemed to try to call and to make merry with their
grandsires; to whom the women showed the little ones, and said,
weeping: ‘Behold your blood, which with such heat and fury
you are seeking to shed with your own hands.’</p>

<p class='c001'>“The women’s dutifulness and wisdom wrought such great
effect at this pass, that not only were lasting friendship and
union established between the two hostile kings, but what was
stranger, the Sabines came to live at Rome, and of the two peoples
a single one was made. And thus this union greatly increased
the power of Rome, thanks to those wise and lofty-minded
women, who were rewarded by Romulus in such fashion
that in dividing the people into thirty wards he gave thereto the
names of the Sabine women.”</p>

<p class='c001'>31.—Here having paused a little, and seeing that my lord Gaspar
did not speak, the Magnifico Giuliano said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you not think that these women were the cause of good
to their men-folk and contributed to the greatness of Rome?”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Gaspar replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“No doubt they were worthy of much praise; but had you
been as willing to tell the sins of women as their good works,
you would not have omitted to say that in this war of Titus
Tatius a woman betrayed Rome and showed the enemy the way
to seize the Capitol, whereby the Romans came near being all
destroyed.”<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c016'><sup>[370]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico Giuliano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You tell me of a single bad woman, while I tell you of countless
good ones; and besides those already mentioned, I could
show you a thousand other instances on my side, of benefits done
to Rome by women, and could tell you why a temple was dedicated
of old to Venus Armata,<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c016'><sup>[371]</sup></a> and another to Venus Calva,<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c016'><sup>[372]</sup></a>
and how the Festival of the Handmaidens was instituted in
honour of Juno because handmaidens once delivered Rome from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>the wiles of the enemy.<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c016'><sup>[373]</sup></a> But leaving all these things aside, did
not that lofty deed—the discovery of Cataline’s conspiracy,
whereof Cicero so vaunts himself—spring chiefly from a vile
woman?<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c016'><sup>[374]</sup></a>—who for this might be said to have been the cause
of all the good that Cicero boasts of having wrought the Roman
commonwealth. And had I time enough, I should further show
you that women have often corrected many of men’s errours;
but I fear that this discourse of mine is already too long and
wearisome: so, having performed according to my ability the
task imposed upon me by these ladies, I think it well to give
place to someone who will say things worthier to be listened to
than any I can say.”</p>

<p class='c001'>32.—Then my lady Emilia said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not deprive women of those true praises that are their
due; and remember that if my lord Gaspar, and perhaps my lord
Ottaviano as well, listen to you with weariness, we and all these
other gentlemen listen to you with pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico still wished to stop, but all the ladies began
begging him to speak: whereupon he said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“In order not to make my lord Gaspar more my enemy than
he is, I will tell briefly of a few women who occur to my mind,
omitting many that I might mention.” Then he continued:
“When Philip, son of Demetrius, was laying siege to the city of
Chios, he issued an edict promising freedom and their masters’
wives to all slaves who should escape from the city and come to
him. So great was the women’s wrath at this shameful edict
that they rushed to the walls in arms, and fought so fiercely that
in a short time they drove Philip off with disgrace and loss:
which their husbands had not been able to do.<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c016'><sup>[375]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“When these same women came to Leuconia with their husbands,
fathers and brothers (who were going into exile), they
performed a deed no less glorious than this: the Erythræans,<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c016'><sup>[376]</sup></a>
who were there with their allies, waged war upon these Chiotes,
who were unable to resist, and so bound themselves to quit the
city in tunic and shift only. Hearing of this shameful bargain,
the women bewailed and upbraided the men for abandoning
their weapons and going forth almost naked among the enemy;
and the men answering that they were already bound, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>women told them to wear their shields and spears and leave
their clothes behind, and to tell the enemy that this was their
attire. And thus, acting upon the advice of their women, they in
great part atoned for the shame that they could not wholly
escape.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Again, Cyrus having routed an army of Persians in battle, in
fleeing to their city they met their women outside the gate, who,
stopping in the way, said: ‘Whither do ye flee, base men?
Would ye perchance hide yourselves in us, from whence ye
came?’ On hearing these and other like words, and being sensible
how inferior they were in courage to their women, the men
were ashamed, and returning against the enemy, fought with him
anew and routed him.”<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c016'><sup>[377]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>33.—Having thus far spoken, the Magnifico stopped, and turning
to my lady Duchess, said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, my Lady, you will give me leave to be silent.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Gaspar replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You will forsooth have to be silent, for you do not know
what more to say.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You provoke me so, that you run risk of having to listen to
women’s praises all night; and to hear of many Spartan women
who rejoiced in the glorious death of their children;<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c016'><sup>[378]</sup></a> and of
those who disowned or even slew theirs when seen to behave
basely. Then how in the ruin of their country the Saguntine
women took up arms against the forces of Hannibal;<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c016'><sup>[379]</sup></a> and how,
when Marius overcame the army of the Germans, the women,
being unable to get leave to live free at Rome in the service of
the Vestal Virgins, all killed themselves and their little children;<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c016'><sup>[380]</sup></a>
and of a thousand others whereof all the ancient histories
are full.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, my lord Magnifico, but God knows how those things
happened; for that age is so remote from us that many lies can
be told and there is none to refute them.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec3.34'></a>34.—The Magnifico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“If in every age you will compare women’s worth with that of
men, you will find that they have never been and are not now at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>all inferior to men in worth; for leaving aside the times that are
so ancient, if you come to the time when the Goths ruled in Italy,
you will find that there was a queen among them, Amalasontha,<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c016'><sup>[381]</sup></a>
who long reigned with admirable wisdom; then Theodolinda,<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c016'><sup>[382]</sup></a>
queen of the Lombards, of singular worth; Theodora,<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c016'><sup>[383]</sup></a>
the Greek empress; and in Italy among many others the
Countess Matilda was a most illustrious lady, of whose praises I
will leave Count Ludovico to speak, since she was of his family.”<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c016'><sup>[384]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay,” said the Count, “that rests with you, for you know it
does not become a man to praise what is his own.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“And how many women in times past do you find belonging to
this most noble house of Montefeltro!<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c016'><sup>[385]</sup></a> How many of the house
of Gonzaga, of Este, of Pio!<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c016'><sup>[386]</sup></a> Then, if we wish to speak of the
present times, we shall have no need to seek very far for instances,
because we have them at home. But I shall not avail
myself of those we see before us, lest you pretend to grant me
out of courtesy that which you can in no wise deny. And to go
outside of Italy, remember that we in our day have seen Queen
Anne of France,<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c016'><sup>[387]</sup></a> a very great lady not less in worth than in
state; and if you will compare her in justice and clemency, liberality
and pureness of life, with Kings Charles<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c016'><sup>[388]</sup></a> and Louis<a href='#f250' class='c016'><sup>[250]</sup></a> (to
both of whom she was consort), you will not find her at all their
inferior. You see madonna Margarita<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c016'><sup>[389]</sup></a> (daughter of the Emperor
Maximilian)<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c016'><sup>[390]</sup></a> who has until now governed and still governs
her state with the utmost wisdom and justice.</p>

<p class='c001'>35.—“But laying all others aside, tell me, my lord Gaspar, what
king or what prince has there been in our days, or even for many
years past in Christendom, who deserves to be compared with
Queen Isabella of Spain?”<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c016'><sup>[391]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Gaspar replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“King Ferdinand, her husband.”<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c016'><sup>[392]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“That I shall not deny; for since the queen judged him worthy
to be her husband, and so loved and honoured him, we cannot
say that he did not deserve to be compared with her: yet I
believe that the fame he had by her was a dowry not inferior to
the kingdom of Castile.”</p>

<p>ISABELLA THE CATHOLIC<br />1451-1504</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Much enlarged from a part of Laurent’s photograph (no. 533) of an altar-piece, formerly
in the royal chapel of the Convent of St. Thomas de Avila, but now in the Prado
Gallery at Madrid. It was painted about 1491 by order of the Inquisitor Torquemada,
and has been attributed to Miguel Zittoz.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>“Nay,” replied my lord Gaspar, “I think that Queen Isabella
had credit for many of King Ferdinand’s deeds.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the Magnifico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Unless the people of Spain,—lords, commons, men and
women, poor and rich,—have all agreed to lie in praise of her,
there has not been in our time on earth a brighter example of
true goodness, of lofty spirit, of wisdom, of piety, of purity, of
courtesy, of liberality,—in short, of every virtue,—than Queen
Isabella; and although the fame of that illustrious lady is very
great in every place and among every nation, those who lived in
her company and were witness to her actions, do all affirm that
this fame sprang from her virtue and merits. And whoever will
consider her deeds will easily perceive such to be the truth. For
leaving aside countless things that give proof of this and could
be told if it were our theme, everyone knows that when she came
to reign she found the greater part of Castile usurped by the
grandees; yet she recovered the whole so righteously and in
such fashion that the very men who were deprived of it, remained
very devoted to her and content to give up that which
they possessed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A very noted thing also is with what courage and wisdom
she always defended her realms against very powerful enemies;
and likewise to her alone can be given the honour of the glorious
conquest of the kingdom of Granada; for in this long and difficult
war against obstinate enemies,—who were fighting for property,
for life, for religion, and (to their thinking) for God,—she
always showed, both in her counsel and in her very person, such
virtue that perhaps few princes in our time have had the hardihood,
I will not say to imitate, but even to envy her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Besides this, all who knew her affirm that she had such a
divine manner of ruling that her mere wish seemed enough to
make every man do quietly that which he ought to do; so that men
hardly dared in their own houses and secretly to do anything they
thought would displease her: and in great part the cause of this
was the admirable judgment she had in discerning and choosing
right agents for the duties she meant to employ them in; and so
well did she know how to unite the rigour of justice with the
gentleness of mercy and liberality, that in her day there was no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>good man who complained of being ill rewarded, nor any bad
man of being too severely punished. Thus there sprang up
among the people an exceeding great reverence for her, composed
of love and fear, which still remains so implanted in the
minds of all, that they almost seem to think that she looks down
upon them from heaven and must bestow praise or blame upon
them from above; and thus those realms are still governed by
her name and the methods she ordained, so that although her
life is at an end, her authority lives,—like a wheel which, long
revolved with force, still turns of itself for a good space, although
nothing more impels it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Consider also, my lord Gaspar, that in our times nearly all
the men in Spain who are great or famous for anything whatever,
were made so by Queen Isabella; and Consalvo Ferdinando,
the Great Captain, was far prouder of this than of all his
famous victories, and of those eminent and worthy deeds which
have made him so bright and illustrious in peace and war, that
if fame is not very thankless, she will always herald his immortal
praises to the world, and give proof that we have in our age
had few kings or great princes who have not been surpassed by
him in magnanimity, wisdom, and in every virtue.</p>

<p class='c001'>36.—“Returning now to Italy, I say that here too there is no
lack of very admirable ladies; for in Naples we have two remarkable
queens;<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c016'><sup>[393]</sup></a> and a short time since there died at Naples
also the other queen of Hungary,<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c016'><sup>[394]</sup></a> you know how admirable a
lady, and worthy to be the peer of the unconquerable and
glorious king, Matthias Corvinus, her husband.<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c016'><sup>[395]</sup></a> Likewise the
Duchess Isabella of Aragon, worthy sister to King Ferdinand of

<p class='c004'>Reduced from a part of Braun’s photograph (no. 34.093) of the portrait by Titian (1477-1576)
in the Imperial Museum at Vienna. The picture was painted about 1536 from a
portrait painted about 1511 by Francesco Raibolini, better known as Francia, (1450-1517).
See Alessandro Luzio’s article in the <cite>Emporium</cite> (Bergamo), nos. 65-6.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>“If you come to Lombardy, you will find my lady Isabella,
Marchioness of Mantua;<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c016'><sup>[397]</sup></a> to whose very admirable virtues injustice
would be done in speaking as soberly as in this place
anyone must needs do who would speak of her at all. I regret,
too, that you did not all know her sister the Duchess Beatrice of
Milan, in order that you might never more have need to marvel
at woman’s capacity.<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c016'><sup>[398]</sup></a> And Eleanora of Aragon, Duchess of
Ferrara and mother of both these two ladies whom I have mentioned,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>was of such sort that her very admirable virtues bore
good witness to all the world that she not only was a worthy
daughter of a king, but deserved to be queen over a much
greater realm than all her ancestors had possessed.<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c016'><sup>[399]</sup></a> And to
tell you of another, how many men do you know in the world
who have borne the cruel blows of fortune as patiently as Queen
Isabella of Naples has done?<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c016'><sup>[400]</sup></a>—who, after the loss of her kingdom,
the exile and death of her husband King Federico<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c016'><sup>[401]</sup></a> and of
two children, and the captivity of her first-born, the Duke of
Calabria,<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c016'><sup>[402]</sup></a> still shows herself to be a queen, and so endures the
grievous burdens of bitter poverty as to give all men proof that
although her fortunes are changed, her rank is not.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I refrain from mentioning countless other ladies, and also
women of low degree; like many Pisan women, who in defence
of their city against the Florentines displayed that generous
daring, without any fear of death, which might have been displayed
by the most unconquerable souls that have ever been on
earth; wherefore some of them have been celebrated by many
noble poets.<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c016'><sup>[403]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“I could tell you of some who were very excellent in letters,
in music, in painting, in sculpture; but I do not wish to go on
selecting from among these instances that are perfectly well
known to you all. It is enough that if you reflect upon the
women whom you yourselves know, it is not difficult for you to
perceive that they are for the most part not inferior in worth and
merits to their fathers, brothers and husbands; and that not a few
have been the source of good to men and often have corrected
many a one of his errours; and if there are not now to be found
on earth those great queens who march to the conquest of distant
lands, and erect great buildings, pyramids and cities,—like
that famous Tomyris, Queen of Scythia, Artemisia, Zenobia,
Semiramis or Cleopatra,<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c016'><sup>[404]</sup></a>—neither are there men like Cæsar,
Alexander, Scipio, Lucullus and those other Roman commanders.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec3.37'></a>37.—“Say not so,” replied Frisio, laughing; “for now more
than ever are there women to be found like Cleopatra or Semiramis;
and if they have not such great states, power and riches,
yet they lack not the good will to imitate those queens in giving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>themselves pleasure, and in satisfying as far as they can all their
appetites.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico Giuliano said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You always wish to go beyond bounds, Frisio; but if there
are some Cleopatras to be found, there is no lack of countless
Sardanapaluses, which is far worse.”<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c016'><sup>[405]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not draw these comparisons, or imagine that men are
more incontinent than women; and even if they were so, it
would not be worse, for from women’s incontinence countless
evils result that do not from men’s. Therefore, as was said yesterday,
it is wisely ordained that women are allowed to fail in
all other things without blame, to the end that they may be able
to devote all their strength to keeping themselves in this one
virtue of chastity; without which their children would be uncertain,
and that tie would be dissolved which binds the whole
world by blood and by the natural love of each man for what
he has produced. Hence loose living is more forbidden to
women than to men, who do not carry their children for nine
months within them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>38.—Then the Magnifico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Verily these are fine arguments which you cite, and I do not
see why you do not commit them to writing.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But tell me why it is not ordained that loose living is as
disgraceful a thing in men as in women, seeing that if men are by
nature more virtuous and of greater worth, they could all the
more easily practise this virtue of continence also; and their
children would be neither more nor less certain, for although
women were unchaste, they could of themselves merely and
without other aid in no wise bear children, provided men were
continent and did not take part in women’s unchastity. But if
you will say the truth, even you know that we men have of our
own authority arrogated to ourselves a licence, whereby we
insist that the same sins are in us very trivial and sometimes
praiseworthy, and in women cannot be sufficiently punished,
unless by shameful death or perpetual infamy at least.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Wherefore, since this opinion is prevalent, methinks it were
a fitting thing to punish severely those also who with lies cast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>infamy on women; and I think that every noble cavalier is
bound always to defend the truth with arms where there is need,
and especially when he knows some woman to be falsely accused
of little chastity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>39.—“And I,” replied my lord Gaspar, laughing, “not only
affirm that which you say is the duty of every noble cavalier, but
I think that it is an act of great courtesy and gentleness to conceal
the fault a woman may have committed through mischance
or over-love; and thus you may see that I am more on the side
of women, where reason permits it, than you are.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not, indeed, deny that men have taken a little liberty;
and this because they know that according to universal opinion
loose living does not bring them the infamy that it does to
women; who by reason of the frailty of their sex are much
more inclined towards their appetites than men are; and if they
sometimes refrain from satisfying their desires, they do so from
shame and not because their will is not quite ready. Therefore
men have put the fear of infamy upon them as a bridle to keep
them almost by force to this virtue, without which they were in
truth little to be prized; for the world has no good from women
except the bearing of children.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But this is not the case with men, who rule cities and armies,
and do so many other things of importance. Since you will
have it so, I do not care to deny that women can do these things;
it is enough that they do not. And when men have seen fit to
set a pattern of continence, they have excelled women in this
virtue as well as in the others also, although you do not admit it.
And as to this I will not rehearse so many histories and fables
as you have done, but merely refer you to the continence of two
very great young lords, and to their victory, which is wont to
make even men of lowest rank insolent. One is that of Alexander
the Great towards the very beautiful women of Darius,—an
enemy, and a vanquished one at that;<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c016'><sup>[406]</sup></a> the other, of Scipio,
who having at the age of twenty-four years taken a city in
Spain by force, there was brought before him a very beautiful
and noble young woman, captured along with many others; and
hearing that she was the bride of a gentleman of the country,
Scipio not only abstained from any wanton act towards her, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>restored her unspotted to her husband, bestowing a rich gift
upon her besides.<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c016'><sup>[407]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“I could tell you of Xenocrates,<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c016'><sup>[408]</sup></a> who was so continent that a
very beautiful woman having laid herself down unclothed beside
him, and employing all the caresses and using all the arts that
she knew, whereof she was an admirable mistress, she had not
the power to make him show the slightest sign of impudicity,
although she tried one whole night long; and of Pericles, who
on merely hearing someone praise a boy’s beauty with overwarmth,
reproved him sharply;<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c016'><sup>[409]</sup></a> and of many others who have
been very continent of their own choice, and not from shame or
fear of punishment, which move most women who practise this
virtue: who for all that deserve to be highly praised, and he
who falsely casts the infamy of unchasteness upon them is
worthy of the heaviest punishment, as you have said.”</p>

<p class='c001'>40.—Then messer Cesare, who had been silent a long while,
said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Think in what fashion my lord Gaspar is wont to speak in
blame of woman, if these are the things that he says in their
praise. But if my lord Magnifico will let me say a few things in
his stead by way of reply to such matters as my lord Gaspar has,
to my thinking, said falsely against women, it were well for both
of us; as he will rest awhile and then be better able to go on to
declare some other excellence of the Court Lady, and I shall
hold myself much favoured at having an opportunity to share
with him this duty of a good cavalier—that is, to defend the
truth.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, I pray you do so,” replied my lord Magnifico; “for
methinks I have already fulfilled my duty to the extent of my
powers, and this discussion is now outside my subject.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Cesare continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am far from wishing to speak of the good that women do
in the world besides the bearing of children, for it has been sufficiently
shown how necessary they are not only to our being,
but to our well-being; but I say, my lord Gaspar, that if they are
as you say more inclined to their appetites than men, and if for
all that they abstain therefrom more than men, which you
admit,—they are as much worthier of praise as their sex is less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>strong to resist their natural appetites. And if you say they do it
from shame, methinks that in place of a single virtue you give
them two; for if shame is stronger in them than appetite and
they for that reason abstain from evil acts, I think that this
shame (which in short is nothing else but fear of infamy) is a
very rare virtue and one possessed by very few men. And if I
could, without infinite disgrace to men, tell how many of them are
plunged in shamelessness (which is the vice opposed to this
virtue), I should pollute these chaste ears that hear me. These
offenders against God and nature are for the most part men
already old, who make a calling, some of the priesthood, some
of philosophy, some of sacred law; and govern public affairs
with a Catonian severity of countenance that gives promise of
all the integrity in the world; and always allege the feminine
sex to be very incontinent; nor do they ever lament anything
more than their loss of natural vigor, which renders them unable
to satisfy the abominable desires that still linger in their thoughts
after being denied by nature to their bodies; and hence they
often find ways wherein strength is not necessary.</p>

<p class='c001'>41.—“But I do not wish to say more; and it is enough for me
that you grant me that women abstain from unchaste living
more than men; and certain it is that they are restrained by no
other bridle than that which they themselves put on. That this
is true, the greater part of those who are confined with too close
care, or beaten by their husbands or fathers, are less chaste than
those who have some liberty.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But a great bridle to women generally is their love of true
virtue and their desire for honour, whereof many whom I have
known in my time make more account than of their very life;
and if you will say the truth, every one of us has seen very noble
youths, discreet, wise, valiant and beautiful, spend many years
in love, without omitting aught of care, of gifts, of prayers, of
tears, in short, of anything that can be imagined; and all in vain.
And but that I might be told that my qualities have never made
me worthy of ever being loved, I should call myself as witness,
who have more than once been nigh to death because of a
woman’s unchangeable and too stern chastity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Gaspar replied:</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>“Marvel not at that: for women who are always wooed refuse
to please him who wooes them; and they who are not wooed,
woo others.”<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c016'><sup>[410]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>42.—Messer Cesare said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have never known these men who are wooed by women;
but very many who, on finding that they have tried in vain and
spent time foolishly, resort to this noble revenge, and say they
have had an abundance of that which they have only imagined,
and think it a kind of courtiership to speak evil and invent tales
to the end that slanderous stories of some noble lady may spring
up among the rabble. But such as these, who make vile boast
(whether true or false) of conquering a gentle lady, deserve punishment
or torture most severe; and if they sometimes meet it,
we cannot measure the praise due to those who perform the
office. For if they are telling lies, what villainy can be greater
than to steal from a worthy lady that which she values more
than life? And for no other reason than that which ought to
win endless praise for her? Again, if they are telling the truth,
what punishment could suffice for a man who is so vile as to
reward with such ingratitude a woman, who,—vanquished by
false flatteries, by feigned tears, by continual wooing, by laments,
by arts, tricks and perjuries,—has suffered herself to be led into
too great love, and then without reserve has fondly given herself
a prey to such a malign spirit?</p>

<p class='c001'>“But to answer you further touching that unheard-of continence
of Alexander and Scipio which you have cited, I say I am
unwilling to deny that both performed an act worthy of much
praise; yet to the end that you may not be able to say that in
rehearsing ancient matters I tell you fables, I wish to cite a
woman of low degree in our own times, who showed far more
continence than these two great men.</p>

<p class='c001'>43.—“I say, then, that I once knew a beautiful and gentle girl,
whose name I do not tell you lest you give food for slander to
many fools, who conceive a bad opinion of a woman as soon as
they hear of her being in love. Well, this girl having been long
loved by a noble and well-conditioned youth, began to love him
with all her mind and heart; and of this not only I (to whom
she voluntarily confided everything as if I had been, I will not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>say her brother, but her dearest sister), but all those who saw
her in the presence of the beloved youth, were very certain of
her passion. Loving thus as fervently as a very loving soul can
love, she maintained such continence for two years that she
never gave this youth any token of loving him, except such as
she could not hide; neither would she ever speak to him or
receive letters from him or gifts, although a day never passed
but she was besought to do both. And I well know how she
longed for it, because if she was sometimes able to possess anything
secretly that had been the youth’s, she held it so dear that
it seemed to be the source of her life and all her weal; and
never in all that time would she grant him other pleasure than
to see him and let herself be seen, and to dance with him as with
the others when she took part in public festivals.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And since they were well suited to each other in condition,
the girl and the youth desired that their great love might end
happily, and that they might be man and wife together. The
same was desired by all the other men and women of their city,
except her cruel father, who out of perverse and strange caprice
wished to marry her to another and richer man; and to this the
unhappy girl opposed naught but very bitter tears. And the
ill-starred marriage having been concluded, with much pity from
the people and to the despair of the poor lovers, even this blow
of fortune did not avail to destroy the love so deeply rooted in
their hearts; which still endured for the space of three years,
although she very prudently concealed it and sought in every
way to stifle those desires that now were hopeless. And all this
time she kept her stern resolve of continence; and as she could
not honourably possess him whom alone in the world she
adored, she chose not to wish for him in any wise, and to follow
her custom of accepting neither messages nor gifts nor even
glances from him; and in this fixed resolve, the poor girl, overcome
by sharpest anguish and grown very wasted from long
passion, died at the end of three years, preferring to renounce
the joys and pleasures so eagerly desired, and at last her very
life, rather than her honour. Nor was she without ways and
means of satisfying herself quite secretly and without risk of
disgrace or any other harm; and yet she abstained from that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>which she herself so greatly desired and towards which she was
so urged continually by the person whom alone in the world she
desired to please: nor was she moved therein by fear or any
other motive than mere love of true virtue.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What will you say of another, who for six months spent
nearly every night with a dearly cherished lover; yet, in a garden
full of sweetest fruits, invited by her own most ardent longing
and by the prayers and tears of one dearer to her than life
itself, she refrained from tasting them; and although she was
caught and held in the fast bonds of those beloved arms, she
never yielded herself vanquished, but preserved the flower of
her chastity immaculate.</p>

<p class='c001'>44.—“Do you think, my lord Gaspar, that these acts of continence
are equal to Alexander’s?—who (being most ardently
enamoured, not of Darius’s women, but of that fame and greatness
which incited him by thirst for glory to endure toils and
dangers to make himself immortal) spurned not only other
things, but his own life, in order to win renown above all other
men. And do we marvel that with such thoughts at heart he
abstained from something he did not much desire? For since
he had never seen the women before, he could not possibly love
them in a moment, but perhaps even loathed them because of his
enemy Darius; and in that case every wanton act of his towards
them would have been outrage and not love. Hence it is no
great thing that Alexander, who conquered the world no less by
magnanimity than by arms, abstained from doing outrage to
women.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Scipio’s continence also is much to be praised. Yet if you
consider rightly, it is not to be compared with these two women’s;
for he too likewise abstained from something not desired;—being
in a hostile country, newly in command, at the beginning of a
very important enterprise; having left great expectations of himself
at home, and bound to render an account to very strict
judges, who often punished very small mistakes as well as great,
and among whom he knew he had enemies; conscious also that
if he acted otherwise (the lady being very noble and married to
a very noble lord), he might arouse so many enemies and in such
fashion that they might long hinder and perhaps quite snatch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>away his success. Hence, for reasons thus many and important,
he abstained from a light and harmful wish, displaying continence
and generous uprightness; which, as it is written, gave
him the entire good will of those nations, and was worth another
army to him, wherewith by gentleness to conquer hearts that
perhaps would have been unconquerable by force of arms.<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c016'><sup>[411]</sup></a></p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>“Forgive me, my lord Gaspar, if I say the truth, for in short
these are the miraculous continences that men write about themselves
while accusing women of incontinence, in whom we every
day see countless tokens of continence; for in truth, if you consider
well, there is no fortress so impregnable and well defended
that, if it were assailed with a thousandth part of the wiles and
tricks that are employed to overcome the steadfast heart of
woman, it would not surrender at the first assault.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How many creatures of great lords,—enriched by them and
placed in very high esteem, entrusted with their castles and
fortresses, whereon depend their whole state, life and weal,—have
basely and sordidly surrendered these to such as had no
right thereto, without shame or fear of being called traitors?
And would to God there were so great a dearth of such men in
our days, that we might have no more trouble to find a man who
had done his duty in this regard, than to name those who have
failed in theirs. Do we not see many others who daily go about
slaying men in the forest and scouring the sea solely to steal
money?</p>

<p class='c001'>“How many prelates sell the property of God’s church! How
many lawyers forge wills! How many perjurers bear false
witness only to get money! How many physicians poison the
sick to the same end! Again, how many do the vilest things
from fear of death! And yet a tender and delicate girl often
resists all these sharp and hard encounters; for many have been
found who preferred death rather than lose their chastity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>47.—Then my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“These, messer Cesare, I believe are not on earth to-day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Cesare replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will not cite the ancients now; but I tell you this, that many
would be and are to be found, who in such case do not fear to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>die. And now I remember that when Capua was sacked by the
French (which was not so long ago that you cannot recall it
very well),<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c016'><sup>[412]</sup></a> a beautiful young Capuan lady being led out of her
house, where she had been captured by a company of Gascons,
when she reached the river that flows through Capua,<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c016'><sup>[413]</sup></a> she pretended
that she wished to tie her shoe, so that he who was leading
her let her go a little, and she suddenly threw herself into
the river.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What will you say of a peasant girl, who not many months
ago, at Gazuolo in the Mantuan territory,<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c016'><sup>[414]</sup></a> went with her sister
to reap corn in the fields, and being overcome with thirst, entered
a house for a drink of water; and the master of the house, who
was a young man, seeing that she was very beautiful and alone,
took her in his arms, and first with soft words, and then with
threats, sought to persuade her to his wishes; and she resisting
more and more stubbornly, he at last overcame her with many
blows and with force. So, dishevelled and weeping, she went
back to her sister in the field, nor would she for all her sister’s
urgent questioning tell what outrage she had received in that
house; but on the way home, feigning to grow calmer little by
little and to speak quite without agitation, she gave her sister
some directions. Then when she came to the Oglio, which is
the river that flows by Gazuolo,<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c016'><sup>[415]</sup></a> she left her sister a little behind
not knowing or imagining what she meant to do, and suddenly
threw herself in. Wailing and weeping her sister ran
after her as fast as possible along the bank of the river, which
was bearing her down-stream very rapidly: and each time the
poor creature rose to the surface, her sister threw her a cord
which they had to bind the corn, and although the cord reached
her hands several times (for she was still near the bank), the
steadfast and determined girl always refused it and put it from
her; and thus rejecting every aid that might save her life, she
soon died: nor was she moved by nobility of birth, nor by fear
of most cruel death or of infamy, but solely by grief for her
lost virginity.<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c016'><sup>[416]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Now from this you can understand how many other women,
who are not known, perform acts most worthy of praise; for
although this one gave such proof of her virtue only three days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>since, as one may say, there is no talk of her and even her name
is unknown. But if the death of our lady Duchess’s uncle, the
Bishop of Mantua,<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c016'><sup>[417]</sup></a> had not occurred at that time, the bank of
the Oglio, at the place where she threw herself in, would have
been graced by a very beautiful monument to the memory of
that glorious soul, which deserved so much the brighter fame
after death, because in life it dwelt in a less noble body.”</p>

<p class='c001'>48.—Here messer Cesare made a little pause; then he continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“At Rome, in my day, there happened another like case; and it
was that a beautiful and noble Roman girl, being long pursued
by one who seemed to love her much, was never willing to
favour him at all, even with a single look. So, by means of
money he corrupted one of her women; who, desirous of satisfying
him in order to get more money from him, persuaded her
mistress to visit the church of San Sebastiano on a certain day
of small solemnity;<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c016'><sup>[418]</sup></a> and having made everything known to the
lover and shown him what he must do, she led the girl to one of
those dark caves which nearly all who go to San Sebastiano are
wont to visit; and in this the young man was already hidden
secretly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Finding himself alone with her whom he loved so much, he
began in all ways to beg her as gently as he could to have pity
on him and change her former hardness to love. But after he
saw all his prayers to be in vain, he had resort to threats, which
failing too, he began to beat her cruelly; at last, although firmly
resolved to attain his end, by force if necessary, and therein
employing the help of the infamous woman who had led her
thither, he was never able to bring her to consent. Nay, with
both word and deed (although she had little strength), the poor
girl defended herself to the last: so that partly from anger at
seeing that he could not obtain what he desired, partly from fear
lest her relatives might make him suffer for it when they learned
the thing, this wretch, with the help of the servant (who feared
the like), strangled the unhappy girl and left her there; and
having fled, he took means not to be discovered. Blinded by her
very crime, the servant could not flee, and being taken into
custody on suspicion, confessed everything and so was punished
as she deserved.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“The body of the steadfast and noble girl was taken from that
cave with the greatest honour and brought to Rome for burial,
with a laurel crown upon her head, and accompanied by a
countless host of men and women; among whom there was no
one who went home without tears in his eyes; and thus was this
rare soul universally mourned as well as praised by all the
people.</p>

<p class='c001'>49.—“But to speak to you of those whom you yourselves know,
do you not remember having heard that when my lady Felice
della Rovere was journeying to Savona,<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c016'><sup>[419]</sup></a> and feared that some
sails that were sighted were vessels of Pope Alexander in pursuit
of her, she made ready with fixed resolve to cast herself
into the sea, in case they should come up and there was no
remedy by flight: and it is in no wise to be believed that she
acted in this from lightness, for you know as well as any other
with what intelligence and wisdom this lady’s singular beauty
was accompanied.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nor can I refrain from saying a word of our lady Duchess,
who having for fifteen years lived like a widow in company with
her husband, not only was steadfast in never revealing this to
anyone in the world, but when urged by her own people to lay
aside her widowhood, she chose rather to endure exile, poverty
and every other sort of hardship, than to accept that which
seemed to all others great favour and blessing of fortune;”<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c016'><sup>[420]</sup></a> and
as messer Cesare was going on to speak of this, my lady Duchess
said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Speak of something else, and go no further with this subject,
for you have many other things to say.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Cesare continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yet I know you will not deny this, my lord Gaspar, nor you,
Frisio.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed no,” replied Frisio; “but one does not make a host.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec3.50'></a>50.—Then messer Cesare said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is true that such great results as these are met in few
women: still, those also who withstand the assaults of love are
all admirable; and those who are sometimes overcome deserve
much pity: for certainly the urgence of lovers, the arts they use,
the snares they spread, are so many and so continual that it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>but too great a wonder that a tender girl can escape. What
day, what hour, ever passes that the persecuted girl is not
besought by the lover with money, gifts and all things that must
please her? When can she ever go to her window, but she shall
always see her persistent lover pass, silent in word but with eyes
that speak, with sad and languid face, with those burning sighs,
often with most abundant tears? When does she ever go forth
to church or other place, but he is always before her, and meets
her at every turn of the street with his melancholy passion depicted
in his eyes, as if he were expecting instant death? I leave
aside the fripperies, inventions, mottoes, devices, festivals, dances,
games, masques, jousts, tourneys!—all which things she knows
are made for her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then at night she can never wake but she hears music, or at
least his unquiet spirit sighing about the house walls and making
lamentable sounds. If by chance she wishes to speak to one of
her women, the wench (already corrupted with money) soon has
ready a little gift, a letter, a sonnet or some such thing to give
her on the lover’s behalf, and then coming in opportunely, makes
her understand how the poor man is burning with love, and in
her service cares naught for his own life; and how he seeks
nothing from her that is less than seemly, and only desires to
speak with her. Then remedies are found for all difficulties,
false keys, rope ladders, sleeping potions; the thing is painted as
of little consequence; instances are given of many other women
who do far worse. Thus everything is made so easy that she
has no further trouble than to say, ‘I am willing.’ And even
if the poor girl holds back for a time, they add so many inducements,
find so many ways, that with their continual battering
they break down that which stays her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And when they see that blandishments do not avail them,
there are many who have resort to threats and say they will
accuse the woman to her husband of being what she is not.
Others bargain boldly with the fathers and often with the husbands,
who for money or to get favours give their own daughters
and wives as an unwilling prey. Others seek by incantations
and sorceries to steal from them that liberty which God has
bestowed upon their souls: whereof startling results are seen.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>“But I could not in a thousand years rehearse all the wiles
that men employ to bring women to their wishes, for the wiles
are infinite; and besides those that every man finds for himself,
writers have not been lacking who have ingeniously composed
books and therein taken every pains to teach how women are to
be duped in these matters.<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c016'><sup>[421]</sup></a> Now, among so many snares, think
how there can be any safety for these simple doves, lured by such
sweet bait. And what wonder is it, then, if a woman (seeing
herself thus loved and adored for many years by a beautiful,
noble and accomplished youth, who a thousand times a day puts
himself in danger of death to serve her, nor ever thinks of aught
but to please her) is finally brought to love him by continual
wearing (as water wears the hardest marble), and, conquered by
this passion, contents him with that which you say she in the
weakness of her sex desires more than her lover? Do you think
that this errour is so grave that the poor creature who has been
caught by so many flatteries, does not deserve even that pardon
which is often vouchsafed to homicides, thieves, assassins and
traitors? Will you insist that this offence is so heinous that
because you find some woman commits it, womankind ought to
be wholly despised and held universally devoid of continence,
without regard to the many who are found unconquerable, and
who are proof against love’s continual incitements, and firmer in
their infinite constancy than rocks against the surges of the
ocean?”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec3.51'></a>51.—Messer Cesare having ceased speaking, my lord Gaspar
then began to reply, but my lord Ottaviano said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“For the love of Heaven, pray grant him the victory, for I
know you will profit little; and methinks I see that you will
make not only all these ladies your enemies, but the greater
part of the men also.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Gaspar laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, the ladies have great cause to thank me; for if I had
not gainsaid my lord Magnifico and messer Cesare, all these
praises which they have bestowed upon women would not have
been heard.”</p>

been attributed to Miguel Zittoz.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Cesare said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“The things that my lord Magnifico and I have said in praise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>of women, and many others too, were very well known and
hence superfluous.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who does not know that without women we can feel no
content or satisfaction throughout this life of ours, which but for
them would be rude and devoid of all sweetness and more
savage than that of wild beasts? Who does not know that
women alone banish from our hearts all vile and base thoughts,
vexations, miseries, and those turbid melancholies that so often
are their fellows? and if you will consider well the truth, we
shall also see that in our understanding of great matters women
do not hamper our wits but rather quicken them, and in war
make men fearless and brave beyond measure. And certainly
it is impossible for vileness ever again to rule in a man’s heart
where once the flame of love has entered; for whoever loves
desires always to make himself as lovable as he can, and always
fears lest some disgrace befall him that may make him to be
esteemed lightly with her by whom he desires to be esteemed
highly. Nor does he stop at risking his life a thousand times
a day to show himself worthy of her love: hence whoever could
form an army of lovers and have them fight in the presence of
the ladies of their love, would conquer all the world, unless there
were opposed to it another army similarly in love. And be well
assured that Troy’s ten years’ resistance against all Greece proceeded
from naught else but a few lovers, who on sallying forth
to battle, armed themselves in the presence of their women; and
often these women helped them and spoke some word to them
at leaving, which inflamed them and made them more than
men. Then in battle they knew that they were watched by
their women from the walls and towers; wherefore it seemed to
them that every act of hardihood they performed, every proof
they gave, won them their women’s praise, which was the
greatest reward they could have in the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are many who think that the victory of King Ferdinand
of Spain and Queen Isabella against the King of Granada was in
great part due to women; for very often when the Spanish army
went out to meet the enemy, Queen Isabella went out also with
all her maids of honour, and in the army went many noble cavaliers
who were in love. These always went conversing with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>their ladies until they reached the place where the enemy were
seen, then taking leave each of his own lady, they went on in
this presence to meet the enemy with that fierce spirit which
was aroused in them by their love and by the desire to make
their ladies sensible of being served by men of valour; thus a
very few Spanish cavaliers were often found putting a host of
Moors to flight and to death, thanks to gentle and beloved women.</p>

<p class='c001'>“So I do not see, my lord Gaspar, what perversity of judgment
has led you to cast reproach on women.</p>

<p class='c001'>52.—“Do you not know that the origin of all the graceful exercises
that give pleasure in the world is to be ascribed to none
other than to women? Who learns to dance and caper gallantly
for aught else than to please women? Who studies the sweetness
of music for other cause than this? Who tries to compose
verses, in the vernacular at least, unless to express those feelings
that are inspired by women? Think how many very noble
poems we should be deprived of, both in the Greek tongue and
in the Latin, if women had been lightly esteemed by the poets.
But to pass all the others by, would it not have been a very
great loss if messer Francesco Petrarch, who so divinely wrote
his loves in this language of ours, had turned his mind solely to
things Latin, as he would have done if the love of madonna
Laura had not sometimes drawn him from them?<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c016'><sup>[422]</sup></a> I do not
name you the bright geniuses now on earth and present here,
who every day put forth some noble fruit and yet choose their
subject only from the beauties and virtues of women.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You see that Solomon, wishing to write mystically of things
lofty and divine, to cover them with a graceful veil composed a
fervent and tender dialogue between a lover and his sweetheart,
deeming that he could not here below find any similitude more
apt and befitting things divine than love for women; and in this
way he tried to give us a little of the savour of that divinity
which he both by knowledge and by grace knew better than the
rest.<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c016'><sup>[423]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Hence there was no need, my lord Gaspar, to dispute about
this, or at least so wordily: but by gainsaying the truth you have
prevented us from hearing a thousand other fine and weighty
matters concerning the perfection of the Court Lady.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>My lord Gaspar replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I believe nothing more is left to say; yet if you think that my
lord Magnifico has not adorned her with enough good qualities,
the fault lay not with him, but with the one who arranged that
there are not more virtues in the world; for the Magnifico gave
her all there are.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lady Duchess said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You shall now see that my lord Magnifico will find still
others.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed, my Lady, methinks I have said enough, and for my
part I am content with this Lady of mine; and if these gentlemen
will not have her as she is, let them leave her to me.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec3.53'></a>53.—Here everyone remaining silent, messer Federico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My lord Magnifico, to spur you on to say something more, I
should like to put you a question concerning what you would
have the chief business of the Court Lady, and it is this: that I
wish to hear how she ought to conduct herself with respect to
one detail which seems to me very important; for although the
excellent qualities wherewith you have endowed her include
genius, wisdom, good sense, ease of bearing, modesty, and so
many other virtues, whereby she ought in reason to be able to
converse with everyone and on every theme, still I think that
more than anything else she needs to know that which belongs
to discussions on love. For as every gentle cavalier uses those
noble exercises, elegances and fine manners that we have mentioned,
as a means to win the favour of women, to this end likewise
he employs words; and not only when he is moved by passion,
but often also to do honour to the lady with whom he is
speaking, since he thinks that to give signs of love for her is a
proof that she is worthy of it, and that her beauty and merits are
so great that they compel every man to serve her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hence I fain would know how this lady ought to converse on
such a theme discreetly, and how reply to him who loves her
truly, and how to him who makes a false pretence thereof; and
whether she ought to feign not to understand, whether to return
his love or to refuse, and how conduct herself.”</p>

<p class='c001'>54.—Then my lord Magnifico said:</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>“It would be needful to teach her first to distinguish those
who pretend to love and those who love truly; then, as to returning
love or not, I think she ought not to be governed by any
others’ wish but her own.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Federico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then teach her what are the surest and safest signs to discern
false love from true, and with what proof she ought to be
content in order to be sure of the love shown her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico replied, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I know not, for men to-day are so cunning that they make
false pretences without end, and sometimes weep when they
have great wish to laugh; hence it were necessary to send them
to Isola Ferma under the True Lovers’ Arch.<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c016'><sup>[424]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“But to the end that this Lady of mine (of whom it behooves
me to take special care, since she is my creation) may not fall
into those errours wherein I have seen many others fall, I should
tell her not to be quick to believe herself loved, nor act like some
who not only do not feign not to understand when court is paid
to them even covertly, but at the first word accept all the praise
that is given them, or decline it with a certain air that is rather
an invitation to love for those with whom they are speaking,
than a refusal.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore the course of conduct that I wish my Court Lady
to pursue in love talk, will be to refuse always to believe that
whoever pays court to her for that reason loves her: and if the
gentleman shall be as pert as many are, and speak to her with
small respect, she will give him such answer that he may
clearly understand he is causing her annoyance. Again, if he
shall be discreet and use modest phrases and words of love
covertly, with that gentle manner which I think the Courtier
fashioned by these gentlemen will employ, the lady will feign
not to understand and will apply his words in another sense,
always modestly trying to change the subject with that skill and
prudence which have been said befit her. If, again, the talk is
such that she cannot feign not to understand, she will take it all
as a jest, pretending to be aware that it is said to her more out
of compliment to her than because it is so, depreciating her
merits and ascribing the praises that he gives her to the gentleman’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>courtesy; and in this way she will win a name for discretion
and be safer against deceit.</p>

<p class='c001'>“After this fashion methinks the Court Lady ought to conduct
herself in love talk.”</p>

<p class='c001'>55.—Then messer Federico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My lord Magnifico, you discourse of this matter as if everyone
who pays court to women must needs speak lies and seek
to deceive them: if the which were true, I should say that your
teachings were sound; but if this cavalier who is speaking loves
truly and feels that passion which sometimes so sorely afflicts
the human heart, do you not consider in what pain, in what
calamity and mortal anguish you put him by insisting that the
lady shall never believe anything he says on this subject? Ought
his supplications, tears, and many other signs to go for naught?
Have a care, my lord Magnifico, lest it be thought that besides
the natural cruelty which many of these ladies have in them,
you are teaching them still more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I spoke not of him who loves, but of him who entertains
with amourous talk, wherein one of the most necessary conditions
is that words shall never be lacking. But just as true
lovers have glowing hearts, so they have cold tongues, with
broken speech and sudden silence; wherefore perhaps it would
not be a false assumption to say: ‘Who loves much, speaks
little.’ Yet as to this I believe no certain rule can be given, because
of the diversity of men’s habits; nor could I say anything
more than that the Lady must be very cautious, and always bear
in mind that men can declare their love with much less danger
than women can.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec3.56'></a>56.—Then my lord Gaspar said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Would you not, my lord Magnifico, have this admirable
Lady of yours love in return even when she knows that she is
loved truly? For if the Courtier were not loved in return, it is
not conceivable that he should go on loving her; and thus she
would lose many advantages, and especially that service and
reverence with which lovers honour and almost adore the virtue
of their beloved.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“As to that,” replied the Magnifico, “I do not wish to give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>advice; but I do say that I think love, as you understand it, is
proper only for unmarried women; for when this love cannot
end in marriage, the lady must always find in it that remorse
and sting which things illicit give her, and run risk of staining
that reputation for chastity which is so important to her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Federico replied, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“This opinion of yours, my lord Magnifico, seems to me very
austere, and I think you have learned it from some preacher—one
of those who rebuke women for loving laymen, in order to
have themselves the better part therein. And methinks you impose
too hard a rule on married women, for many of them are
to be found whose husbands bear them the greatest hatred
without cause, and affront them grievously, sometimes by loving
other women, sometimes by causing them all the annoyances
possible to devise; some against their will are married by their
fathers to old men, infirm, loathsome and disgusting, who make
them live in continual misery. If such women were allowed to
be divorced and separated from those with whom they are ill
mated, perhaps it would not be fitting for them to love any but
their husbands; but when, either by enmity of the stars or by unfitness
of temperament or by other accident, it happens that the
marriage bed, which ought to be a nest of concord and of love,
is strewn by the accursed infernal fury with the seed of its
venom, which then brings forth anger, suspicion and the stinging
thorns of hatred to torment those unhappy souls cruelly bound
by an unbreakable chain until death,—why are you unwilling
that the woman should be allowed to seek some refuge from the
heavy lash, and to bestow on others that which is not only
spurned but hated by her husband? I am quite of the opinion
that those who have suitable husbands and are loved by them,
ought not to do them wrong; but the others wrong themselves
by not loving those who love them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay,” replied the Magnifico, “they wrong themselves by
loving others than their husbands. Still, since not to love is
often beyond our power, if this mischance shall happen to the
Court Lady (that her husband’s hate or another’s love brings
her to love), I would have her yield her lover nothing but her
spirit; nor ever let her show him any clear sign of love (either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>by words or by gestures or by any other means) by which he
may be sure of it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>57.—Then messer Roberto da Bari said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I appeal from this judgment of yours, my lord Magnifico, and
think I shall have many with me; but since you will teach married
women this rusticity, so to speak, do you wish also to have
the unmarried equally cruel and discourteous?—and complaisant
to their lovers in nothing whatever?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If my Court Lady be unmarried,” replied my lord Magnifico,
“and must love, I wish her to love someone whom she can
marry; nor shall I account it an errour if she shows him some
sign of love: as to which matter I wish to teach her one universal
rule in a few words, to the end that she may with little
pains be able to bear it in mind; and this is, let her show him
who loves her every token of love except such as may imbue her
lover’s mind with the hope of obtaining something wanton from
her. And it is necessary to give great heed to this, for it is an
errour committed by countless women, who commonly desire
nothing more than to be beautiful: and since to have many
lovers seems to them proof of their beauty, they take every
<a id='corr225.21'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='pains'>pain]</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_225.21'><ins class='correction' title='pains'>pain]</ins></a></span> to get as many as they can. Thus they are often carried
into reckless behaviour, and forsaking that temperate modesty
which so becomes them, they employ certain pert looks with
scurrile words and acts full of immodesty, thinking that they are
gladly seen and listened to for this and that by such ways they
make themselves loved: which is false; for the demonstrations
that are made to them spring from desire excited by a belief in
their willingness, not from love. Wherefore I wish that my
Court Lady may not by wanton behaviour seem to offer herself
to anyone who wants her and to do her best to lure the eyes and
appetite of all who look upon her, but that by her merits and
virtuous conduct, by her loveliness, by her grace, she may imbue
the mind of all who see her with that true love which is due to
all things lovable, and with that respect which always deprives
him of hope who thinks of any wantonness.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Moreover, he who is loved by such a woman ought to content
himself with her every slightest demonstration, and to prize
a single loving look from her more than complete possession of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>any other woman; and to such a Lady I should not know how
to add anything, unless to have her loved by so excellent a
Courtier as these gentlemen have described, and to have her
love him also, to the end that they may both attain their complete
perfection.”</p>

<p class='c001'>58.—Having thus far spoken, my lord Magnifico was silent;
whereupon my lord Gaspar said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now, in sooth, you will not be able to complain that my lord
Magnifico has not described a most excellent Court Lady; and
henceforth, if such an one is found, I admit that she deserves to
be esteemed the Courtier’s equal.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lady Emilia replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I engage to find her, provided you will find the Courtier.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Roberto added:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Verily it cannot be denied that the Lady described by my
lord Magnifico is most perfect: nevertheless, as to those last
conditions of love, methinks he has made her a little too austere,
especially when he would have her deprive her lover of all hope,
by words, gestures and behaviour, and do all she can to plunge
the man in despair. For as everyone knows, human desires do
not spend themselves upon those things whereof there is not
some hope. And although a few women may have indeed been
found, haughty perhaps by reason of their beauty and worth,
whose first word to anyone who paid them court was that he
must never expect to have anything from them that he wished,—yet
afterwards they have been a little more gracious to him in
look and manner, so that by their kindly acts they have somewhat
tempered their haughty words. But if this Lady by acts
and words and manner removes all hope, I think our Courtier,
if he is wise, will never love her; and thus she will have the
imperfection of being without a lover.”</p>

<p class='c001'>59.—Then the Magnifico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not wish my Court Lady to remove hope of everything,
but only of wanton things, which (if the Courtier be as courteous
and discreet as these gentlemen have described him) he will not
only not hope for, but will not even wish for. Because if the
beauty, behaviour, cleverness, goodness, knowledge, modesty,
and the many other worthy qualities that we have given the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Lady, are the cause of the Courtier’s love for her, the end of
his love will necessarily be worthy too: and if nobility, excellence
in arms and letters and music, if gentleness and the possession
of so many graces in speech and conversation, be the
means whereby the Courtier is to win the lady’s love, the end of
that love must needs be of like quality with the means whereby
it is attained.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Moreover, just as there are divers sorts of beauty in the
world, so too there are divers tastes in men; and thus it happens
that when they see a woman of that serious beauty, which
(whether she be going or staying or joking or jesting or doing
what you will) always so tempers her whole behaviour as to
induce a certain reverence in anyone who looks upon her,—many
are abashed and dare not serve her; and lured by hope,
they oftener love attractive and enticing women, so soft and tender
as to display in words and acts and looks a certain languourous
passion that promises easily to pass and be changed into
love.</p>

<p class='c001'>“To be safe against deceits, some men love another sort of
women, who are so free of eye and word and movement as to do
the first thing that comes into their mind with a certain simplicity
which does not hide their thoughts. Nor are there lacking
other generous souls, who—(esteeming that worth is shown in
difficulty, and that it would be a victory most sweet to conquer
what to others seems unconquerable), in order to give proof that
their valour is able to force a stubborn mind and persuade to
love even wills that are contrary and recusant thereto,—readily
turn to love the beauties of those women who by eyes and
words and behaviour show more austere severity than the
others. Wherefore these men who are so self-confident, and
who account themselves secure against being deceived, willingly
love certain women also who by cunning and art seem to conceal
a thousand wiles with beauty; or else some others, who
along with their beauty have a coquettishly disdainful manner
of few words and few laughs, with almost an air of prizing little
every man who looks upon them or serves them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then there are certain other men who deign to love only
those women who in face and speech and every movement carry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>all elegance, all gentle manners, all knowledge, and all the
graces heaped together,—like a single flower composed of all
the excellences in the world. Thus if my Court Lady have a
dearth of those loves that spring from evil hope, she will not on
that account be left without a lover; for she will not lack those
loves that spring both from her merits and from her lovers’ confidence
in their own worth, whereby they will know themselves
to be worthy of being loved by her.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec3.60'></a>60.—Messer Roberto still objected, but my lady Duchess held
him in the wrong, supporting my lord Magnifico’s argument;
then she continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“We have no cause to complain of my lord Magnifico, for I
truly think that the Court Lady described by him may stand on
a par with the Courtier, and even with some advantage; for he
has taught her how to love, which these gentlemen did not do
for their Courtier.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the Unico Aretino said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is very fitting to teach women how to love, for rarely have
I seen any that knew how: since they nearly all accompany
their beauty with cruelty and ingratitude towards those who
serve them most faithfully and deserve the reward of their love
by nobility of birth, gentleness and worth; and then they often
give themselves a prey to men who are very silly, base, and of
small account, and who not only love them not, but hate them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“So, to avoid such grievous errours as these, perhaps it was
well to teach them first how to make choice of a man who shall
deserve to be loved, and then how to love him; which is not
needful in the case of men, who know it but too well of themselves.
And here I can be a good witness; for love was never
taught me save by the divine beauty and divinest behaviour of
a Lady whom it was beyond my power not to adore, wherein I
had no need of art or any master;<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c016'><sup>[425]</sup></a> and I think that the same
happens with all who love truly. Hence it were fitting to teach
the Courtier how to make himself loved rather than how to
love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>61.—Here my lady Emilia said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then discourse of this now, my lord Unico.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Unico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>“Methinks reason would require that ladies’ favour should be
won by serving and pleasing them; but by what they deem
themselves served and pleased, I think must needs be learned
from ladies themselves, who often desire things so strange that
there is no man who would imagine the same, and sometimes
they do not themselves know what they desire. Hence it is
right that you, my Lady, who are a woman and so must surely
know what pleases women, should undertake this task, to do the
world so great a benefit.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lady Emilia said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“The very great favour that you always find with women is
good proof that you know all the ways by which their grace is
won; hence it is quite fitting that you should teach them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lady,” replied the Unico, “I could give a lover no more
useful warning than to look to it that you have no influence over
the lady whose favour he seeks; for such good qualities as the
world once thought were in me, together with the sincerest love
that ever was, have not had so much power to make me loved
as you have to make me hated.”</p>

<p class='c001'>62.—Then my lady Emilia replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My lord Unico, God forbid that I should even think, much
less do, anything to make you hated; for besides doing what I
ought not, I should be esteemed of little sense for attempting the
impossible. But since you urge me thus to speak of that which
pleases women, I will speak; and if you shall be displeased,
blame yourself for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think, then, that whoever would be loved must love and be
lovable; and that these two things suffice to win women’s favour.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now to answer that which you accuse me of, I say that
everyone knows and sees that you are very lovable; but whether
you love as sincerely as you say, I am very much in doubt, and
perhaps the others too. For your being too lovable has brought
it to pass that you have been loved by many women: and great
rivers divided into many parts become little streams; so love,
bestowed upon more than one object, has little strength. But
these continual laments of yours, and complaints of ingratitude
in the women you have served (which is not probable, in view
of your great merits), are a certain sort of mystery to hide the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>favours, contentments and pleasures attained by you in love, and
to assure the women who love you and have given themselves to
you, that you will not betray them; and hence also they are content
that you should thus openly display feigned love for others
to hide their real love for you. So, if the women whom you now
pretend to love are not so ready to believe it as you would like,
the reason is because this artfulness of yours in love is beginning
to be understood, not because I make you hated.”</p>

<p class='c001'>63.—Then my lord Unico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not wish to try again to confute your words, because I at
last perceive that it is as much my fate not to be believed when
I say truth, as it is yours to be believed when you say untruth.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Say rather, my lord Unico,” replied by lady Emilia, “that
you do not love as you would have us believe; for if you loved,
all your desire would be to please your beloved lady and to wish
what she wishes, because this is the law of love; but your thus
complaining of her denotes some deceit, as I said, or indeed
gives proof that you wish what she does not wish.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay,” said my lord Unico, “indeed I wish what she wishes,
which is proof that I love her; but I complain that she does not
wish what I wish, which is a token that she loves me not, according
to that same rule that you have cited.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lady Emilia replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“He who begins to love ought also to begin to please his
beloved and bend himself wholly to her wishes, and govern his
by hers; and make his own desires her slaves, and his very soul
like unto an obedient handmaid, nor ever think of aught but to
let it be transformed, if possible, into that of his beloved, and to
account this as his highest happiness; for they do thus who love
truly.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Assuredly,” said my lord Unico, “my highest happiness
would be to have a single wish rule her soul and mine.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It rests with you to have it so,” replied my lady Emilia.</p>

<p class='c001'>64.—Then messer Bernardo interrupted and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Certain it is that he who loves truly bends all his thoughts to
serve and please the lady of his love, without being shown the
way by others; but as these loving services are sometimes not
clearly perceived, I think that besides loving and serving it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>further necessary to make some other demonstration of his love
so evident that the lady cannot hide her knowledge that she is
loved; yet with such modesty withal that he may not seem to
have small respect for her. And since you, my Lady, began to
tell how the lover’s soul must be the obedient handmaid of his
beloved, I pray you explain this secret also, which seems to me
very important.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Cesare laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“If the lover is so modest that he is ashamed to tell her of his
love, let him write it to her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lady Emilia added:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, if he is as discreet as becomes him, he ought to be sure
of not offending her before he declares himself to her.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“All women like to be sued in love, even though they mean to
refuse that which they are sued for.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico Giuliano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You are very wrong; nor should I advise the Courtier ever
to employ this method, unless he be certain of not being repulsed.”</p>

<p class='c001'>65.—“Then what is he to do?” said my lord Gaspar.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“If he must speak or write, let him do it with such modesty
and so warily that his first words shall try her mind, and shall
touch so ambiguously upon her wish as to leave a way and certain
loophole that may enable her to feign not to see that his
discourse imports love, to the end that he may retreat in case of
difficulty and pretend that he spoke or wrote to some other end,
in order to enjoy in safety those intimate caresses and coquetries
that a woman often grants to him who she thinks accepts
them in friendship, and then withholds them as soon as she finds
they are received as demonstrations of love. Hence those men
who are too precipitate and venture thus presumptuously with a
kind of fury and stubbornness, often lose these favours, and
deservedly; for every noble lady regards herself as little
esteemed by him who rudely wooes her before having done her
service.</p>

<p class='c001'>66.—“Therefore in my opinion the way that the Courtier ought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>to take to make his love known to the Lady, seems to me to be
by showing it to her in manner rather than in words;—for verily
more of love’s affection is sometimes revealed in a sigh, in reverence,
in timidity, than in a thousand words;—next by making
his eyes to be faithful messengers to bear the embassies of his
heart, since they often show the passion that is within more
clearly than the tongue itself or letters or other couriers: so that
they not only disclose thoughts, but often kindle love in the
beloved’s heart. Because those quick spirits that issue from the
eyes, being generated near the heart, enter again by the eyes
(whither they are aimed like an arrow at the mark), and naturally
reach the heart as if it were their abode, and mingling with
those other spirits there and with that subtle quality of blood
which they have in them, they infect the blood near the heart to
which they have come, and warm it, and make it like themselves
and ready to receive the impression of that image which they
have brought with them. Travelling thus to and fro over the
road from eyes to heart, and bringing back the tinder and steel
of beauty and grace, little by little these messengers fan with the
breath of desire that fire which glows so ardently and never
ceases to burn because they are always bringing it the fuel
of hope to feed on.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hence it may be well said that eyes are the guide in love,
especially if they are kind and soft; black, of a bright and gentle
blackness, or blue; merry and laughing, so gracious and keen
of glance, like some wherein the channels that give the spirits
egress seem so deep that through them we can see the very
heart. Then the eyes lie in wait, just as in war soldiers lurk in
ambush; and if the form of the whole body is fair and well proportioned,
it attracts and allures anyone who looks upon it from
afar until he approaches, and, as soon as he is near, the eyes dart
forth and bewitch like sorcerers; and especially when they send
out their rays straight to the eyes of the beloved at a moment
when these are doing the same; because the spirits meet, and in
that sweet encounter each receives the other’s quality, as we see
in the case of an eye diseased, which by looking fixedly into a
sound one imparts thereto its own disease. So methinks in this
way our Courtier can in great part manifest his love for his Lady.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>“True it is that if the eyes are not governed with skill, they
often most disclose a man’s amourous desires to whom he least
would do so; for through them there shines forth almost visibly
that ardent passion which (while wishing to reveal it only to his
beloved) the lover often reveals also to those from whom he
most would hide it. Therefore he who has not lost the bridle of
reason, governs himself cautiously and observes time and place,
and abstains when needful from such intent gazing, sweetest
food though it be; for an open love is too difficult a thing.”</p>

<p class='c001'>67.—Count Ludovico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Sometimes even openness does no harm, for in this case men
often think such a love affair is not tending to the end which
every lover desires, seeing that little care is taken to hide it, nor
any heed given whether it be known or not; and so, by not denying
it, a man wins a certain freedom that enables him to speak
openly with his beloved and to be with her without suspicion;
which those do not win who try to be secret, because they seem
to hope for and to be near some great reward that they would
not have others discover.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Moreover I have often seen very ardent love spring up in a
woman’s heart towards a man for whom she had at first not had
the least affection, simply from hearing that many deemed them
to be in love; and I think the reason of this was because such an
universal opinion as that seemed to her sufficient proof to make
her believe the man worthy of her love, and it seemed as if
report brought her messages from the lover much truer and
worthier of belief than he himself could have sent by letters and
words, or another for him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus, this public report not only sometimes does no harm,
but helps.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Love affairs that have report for their minister put a man in
great danger of being pointed at with the finger; and hence he
who would travel this road safely, must feign to have less fire
within him than he has, and content himself with that which
seems little to him, and conceal his desires, jealousies, griefs and
joys, and often laugh with his mouth when his heart is weeping,
and feign to be prodigal of that whereof he most is chary; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>these things are so difficult to do, that they are almost impossible.
Therefore if our Courtier would follow my advice, I
should exhort him to keep his love affairs secret.”</p>

<p class='c001'>68.—Then messer Bernardo said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is need, then, for you to teach him how, and methinks
it is of no small importance; for, besides the signals which men
sometimes make so covertly that almost without a motion the
person whom they wish reads in their face and eyes what is
in their heart,—I have sometimes heard a long and free love
talk between two lovers, of which, however, those present could
understand clearly no details at all or even be sure that the talk
was about love. And the reason of this lay in the speakers’ discretion
and precaution; for without showing any sign of annoyance
at being listened to, they whispered only those words that
signified, and spoke aloud the rest, which could be construed
in different senses.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Federico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“To speak thus minutely about these precautions of secrecy
would be a journey into the infinite; hence I would rather have
some little discussion as to how the lover ought to maintain his
lady’s favour, which seems to me much more necessary.”</p>

<p class='c001'>69.—The Magnifico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think that those means which serve to win it serve also
to maintain it; and all this consists in pleasing the lady of our
love without ever offending her. Wherefore it would be difficult
to give any fixed rule for it; since in countless ways he
who is not very discreet sometimes makes mistakes that seem
little and yet grievously offend the lady’s spirit; and this befalls
those, more than others, who are overmastered by passion: like
some who, whenever they have means of speaking to the lady
whom they love, lament and complain so bitterly and often wish
for things that are so impossible, that they become wearisome
by their very importunity. Others, when they are stung by any
jealousy, allow themselves to be so carried away by their grief
that they heedlessly run into speaking evil of him whom they
suspect, and sometimes without fault either on his part or on the
lady’s, and insist that she shall not speak to him or even turn
her eyes in the direction where he is. And by this behaviour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>they often not only offend the lady, but are the cause that leads
her to love the man: because the fear that lovers sometimes
display lest their lady forsake them for another, shows that they
are conscious of being inferior to him in merits and worth, and
with this idea the lady is moved to love him, and perceiving that
evil is said of him to put him out of favour, she believes it not
although it be true, and loves him all the more.”</p>

<p class='c001'>70.—Then messer Cesare said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I own I am not so wise that I could abstain from speaking
evil of my rival, except you were to teach me some other better
means of ruining him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Magnifico replied, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“There is a proverb which says that when our enemy is in the
water up to the belt, we must offer him our hand and lift him out
of peril; but when he is in up to the chin, we must set our foot
on his head and drown him outright. Thus there are some who
do this with their rival, and as long as they have no safe way of
ruining him, go about dissimulating and pretend to be rather his
friend than otherwise; then if an opportunity offers—such that
they know they can overwhelm him with certain ruin by saying
all manner of evil of him (whether it be true or false),—they do
it without mercy, with craft, deception and all the means they
know how to invent.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But since it would never please me to have our Courtier use
any deceit, I would have him deprive his rival of the lady’s
favour by no other craft than by loving and serving her, and by
being worthy, valiant, discreet and modest; in short, by deserving
her better than his rival, and by being in all things wary and
prudent, abstaining from all stupid follies, wherein many dunces
fall and in diverse ways. For in the past I have known some
who use Poliphilian words in writing and speaking to women,<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c016'><sup>[426]</sup></a>
and so insist upon the niceties of rhetoric, that the women are
diffident of themselves and account themselves very ignorant,
and think each hour of such discourse a thousand years, and rise
before the end. Others are immoderately boastful. Others often
say things that redound to their own discredit and damage, like
some I am wont to laugh at, who profess to be in love and sometimes
say in the presence of women: ‘I have never found a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>woman to love me;’ and they do not perceive that those who
hear them at once conclude that this can arise from no other
reason than that they deserve neither love nor the water they
drink, and hold them for men of slight account, and would not
love them for all the gold in the world, thinking that to love
them would be to stand lower than all the other women who
loved them not.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Still others are so silly that for the purpose of bringing
odium upon some rival of theirs, they say in the presence of
women: ‘So and So is the luckiest man on earth; for although
he is not at all handsome, discreet or valiant, and cannot do or
say more than the rest, yet all the women love him and run after
him;’ and thus showing themselves to be envious of the man’s
good luck, they incite belief that (although he shows himself to
be lovable in neither looks nor acts) he has in him some hidden
quality for which he deserves so many women’s love; hence
those who hear him thus spoken of are by this belief even much
more moved to love him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>71.—Then Count Ludovico laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I assure you that the discreet Courtier will never use these
stupidities to win favour with women.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Cesare Gonzaga replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nor yet that one which was used in my time by a gentleman
of great repute, whose name for the honour of men I will
not mention.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lady Duchess replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“At least tell what he did.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Cesare continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Being loved by a great lady, at her request he came secretly
to the place where she was; and after he had seen her and conversed
with her as long as she and the time allowed, taking his
leave with many bitter tears and sighs, in token of the extreme
sorrow that he felt at such a parting, he besought her to keep
him continually in mind; and then he added that she ought to
pay his board and lodging, for as he had been invited by her, it
seemed to him reasonable that he should be at no charge for his
coming.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then all the ladies began to laugh and to say that he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>quite unworthy to be called a gentleman; and many of the men
were ashamed, with that shame which the man himself would
have rightly felt if he had at any time found wit enough to be
conscious of such a shameful fault.</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Gaspar then turned to messer Cesare, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It was better to refrain from telling this thing for the honour
of women, than to refrain for the honour of men from naming
him; for you can well imagine what good judgment that great
lady had in loving such a senseless animal, and also that of the
many who served her perhaps she had chosen this one as the
most discreet, forsaking and misliking men whose lackey he was
unworthy to be.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Count Ludovico laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Who knows that he was not discreet in other things, and
failed only as to board and lodging? But many times men commit
great follies in their excessive love; and if you will say the
truth, perhaps it has befallen you to commit more than one.”</p>

<p class='c001'>72.—Messer Cesare replied, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“By your faith, do not expose our errours.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay, it is necessary to expose them,” replied my lord Gaspar,
“in order that we may know how to correct them;” then he
added: “My lord Magnifico, now that the Courtier knows how
to win and maintain his lady’s favour and to deprive his rival of
it, you must teach him how to keep his love affairs secret.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magnifico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Methinks I have said enough; so now choose someone else
to speak of this secrecy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Bernardo and all the others began to urge him
anew; and the Magnifico said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You wish to tempt me. All of you are too well practised in
love: yet if you would know more, go read it in Ovid.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And how,” said messer Bernardo, “should I hope that his
precepts are of any service in love, when he recommends and
says it is a very good thing that a man should pretend to be
drunk in the presence of the beloved?<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c016'><sup>[427]</sup></a> See what a fine way of
winning favour! And he cites as a fine method of making one’s
love known to a lady at a banquet, to dip a finger in wine and
write it on the table.”<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c016'><sup>[428]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>The Magnifico replied, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“In those days it was not amiss.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And therefore,” said messer Bernardo, “since such a filthy
trick as this was not offensive to the men of that time, we may
believe that they did not have so gentle a manner of serving
women in love as we have. But let us not forsake our first subject,
of teaching how to keep love secret.”</p>

<p class='c001'>73.—Then the Magnifico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“In my opinion, in order to keep love secret it is needful to
avoid the causes that make it public, which are many; but there
is one chief cause, which is the wish to be too secret and not
trust any person whatever. For every lover desires to make
his passion known to his beloved, and being alone he is forced to
make many more and stronger demonstrations than if he were
aided by some loving and faithful friend; because the demonstrations
that the lover himself makes arouse much greater suspicion
than those he makes through intermediaries. And since the
human mind is naturally curious to find things out, as soon as a
stranger begins to suspect, he employs such diligence that he
learns the truth, and having learned it, makes no scruple to publish
it—nay, sometimes delights to do so; which is not the case
with a friend, who besides helping with comfort and advice, often
repairs those mistakes which the blind lover commits, and always
contrives secrecy and provides for many things for which he
himself cannot provide. Moreover very great relief is felt in
telling our passion and unburdening it to a trusty friend, and likewise
it greatly enhances our joys to be able to impart them.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec3.74'></a>74.—Then my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Another cause discloses love more than this.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what is it?” replied the Magnifico.</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Gaspar continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“The vain ambition joined with madness and cruelty of
women; who, as you yourself have said, try to have as great a
number of lovers as they can, and if it were possible would have
all of these burn and (once made ashes) after death return alive
to die once more. And even although they be in love, still they
delight in their lover’s torment, because they think that pain and
afflictions and continual calling for death give good proof that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>they are loved, and can, by their beauty, make men wretched and
happy, and bestow death and life, as they please. Hence they
feed only on this food, and are so eager for it that (in order not
to be without it) they do not satisfy or ever quite dishearten their
lovers; but to keep these continually in anguish and desire, they
use a certain domineering severity of threats mingled with encouragement,
and fain would have a word, a look, a nod of theirs
esteemed as highest bliss. And to be deemed modest and chaste,
not only by their lovers but by all the rest, they take care to
make their harsh and discourteous behaviour public, to the end
that everyone may think that if they thus maltreat those who
are worthy to be loved, they must treat the unworthy much
worse.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And in this belief, thinking they thus have artfully made
themselves secure against infamy, they often spend every night
with vilest men whom they scarcely know; and so, to enjoy the
calamities and continual laments of some noble cavalier whom
they love, they deny themselves those pleasures which they
might perhaps attain with some excuse; and they are the cause
that forces the poor lover in sheer desperation to behaviour
which brings to light that which every care ought to be taken to
keep most secret.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Some others there are, who, if by trickery they succeed in
leading many a man to think himself loved by them, nourish the
jealousy of each by bestowing caresses and favour on one in the
presence of another; and when they see that he too whom they
most love is nearly sure of being loved because of the demonstrations
shown him, they often put him in suspense by ambiguous
words and pretended anger, and pierce his heart, feigning to care
nothing for him and to wish to give themselves wholly to another;
whence arise hatreds, enmities and countless scandals and manifest
ruin, for in such a case a man must show the passion that
he feels, even though it result in blame and infamy to the lady.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Others, not content with this single torment of jealousy, after
the lover has given all proofs of love and faithful service, and
after they have received the same with some sign of returning it
with good will, they begin to draw back without cause and when
it is least expected, and pretend to believe that he has grown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>lukewarm, and feigning new suspicions that they are not loved,
they give sign of wishing to break with him absolutely. And so,
because of these obstacles, the poor fellow is by very force compelled
to go back to the start and pay court as if his service were
beginning; and daily to walk the earth, and when the lady stirs
abroad to accompany her to church and everywhere she goes,
never to turn his eyes another way: and now he returns to
plaints and sighs and heaviness of heart, and if he can speak
with her, to supplications, blasphemies, despairings, and all those
ragings to which unhappy lovers are put by these fierce monsters,
who have a greater thirst for blood than tigers have.</p>

<p class='c001'>75.—“Such woeful demonstrations as these are but too much seen
and known, and often more by others than by her who occasions
them; and thus in a few days they become so public that not a
step can be taken, nor the least signal given, that is not noted by
a thousand eyes. Then it happens that long before there are any
sweets of love between them, they are believed and judged by all
the world; for when women see that the lover, now nigh to death
and overwhelmed by the cruelty and tortures inflicted on him, is
firmly and really resolving to withdraw, they at once begin to
show him that they love him heartily, and to do him all manner
of kindness, and to yield to him, to the end that (his ardent desire
having failed) the fruits of love may be less sweet to him and he
may have less to thank them for, in order to do everything amiss.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And their love being now very well known, at the same time
all the results that proceed from it are also very well known;
thus the women are dishonoured, and the lover finds that he has
lost time and pains and has shortened his life in sorrows, without
the least advantage or pleasure; for he attained his desires, not
when they would have made him very happy with their pleasantness,
but when he cared little or nothing for them, because
his heart was already so deadened by his cruel passion that
it had no feeling left wherewith to enjoy the delight or contentment
which was offered him.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec3.76'></a>76.—Then my lord Ottaviano said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You held your peace awhile and refrained from saying
evil of women; then you hit them so hard that it seems as if you
were gathering strength, like those who draw back in order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>to strike the harder; and verily you are in the wrong and ought
henceforth to be gentler.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lady Emilia laughed, and turning to my lady Duchess,
said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You see, my Lady, that our adversaries are beginning to
quarrel and differ among themselves.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Call me not so,” replied my lord Ottaviano, “for I am not
your adversary. This contest has displeased me much, not
because I was sorry to see the victory in favour of women, but
because it has led my lord Gaspar to revile them more than
he ought, and my lord Magnifico and messer Cesare to praise
them perhaps a little more than their due; besides which, owing
to the length of the discussion, we have missed hearing many
other fine things that remained to say about the Courtier.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You see,” said my lady Emilia, “that you are our adversary
after all; and for that reason you are displeased with the late
discussion, and fain would not have had so excellent a Court
Lady described; not because you had anything more to say
about the Courtier (for these gentlemen have said all they knew,
and I think that neither you nor anyone else could add anything
whatever), but because of the envy that you have of women’s
honour.”</p>

<p class='c001'>77.—“Certain it is,” replied my lord Ottaviano, “that besides
the things that have been said about the Courtier, I should like
to hear many others. Still, since everyone is content to have
him as he is, I also am content; nor should I change him in
aught else, unless in making him a little more friendly to women
than my lord Gaspar is, albeit perhaps not so much so as some
of these other gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lady Duchess said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“By all means we must see whether your talents are so great
that they can give the Courtier greater perfection than these
gentlemen have given him. So please to say what you have in
mind: else we shall think that even you cannot add anything to
what has been said, but that you wished to detract from the
praises of the Court Lady because you think her the equal of the
Courtier, who you would therefore have us believe could be
much more perfect than these gentlemen have described him.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>My lord Ottaviano laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“The praise and censure that have been bestowed on women
beyond their due have so filled the ears and mind of the company
as to leave no room for anything else to lodge; besides
this, in my opinion the hour is very late.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then,” said my lady Duchess, “we shall have more time by
waiting till to-morrow; and meanwhile this praise and censure,
which you say have been on both sides bestowed excessively on
women, will leave these gentlemen’s minds, and thus they will
better appreciate that truth which you will tell them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So saying, my lady Duchess rose to her feet, and courteously
dismissing the company, retired to her more private room, and
everyone went to rest.</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE COURTIER<br /> BY COUNT BALDESAR CASTIGLIONE</h2>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c005'>
    <div>TO MESSER ALFONSO ARIOSTO</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.1'></a>1.—Thinking to write out the discussions that were held on the
fourth evening, after those mentioned in the previous Books,
among various reflections I feel one bitter thought that strikes
my heart, and makes me mindful of human miseries and our
deceptive hopes: and how fortune, often in mid-course and sometimes
near the end, shatters our frail and vain designs, and sometimes
wrecks them before the haven can be even seen afar.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus I recall that not long after these discussions took place,
importunate death deprived our court of three very rare gentlemen
while they were in the flower of robust health and hope of
honour. And of these the first was my lord Gaspar Pallavicino,
who being assailed by an acute disease and more than once
brought low, although his courage was of such vigour that for a
season it held spirit and body together in spite of death, yet
ended his natural course far before his time;<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c016'><sup>[429]</sup></a> a very great loss
not only to our court and to his friends and family, but to his
native land and to all Lombardy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not long afterwards died messer Cesare Gonzaga, who to all
those who had acquaintance with him left a bitter and painful
memory of his death;<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c016'><sup>[430]</sup></a> for since nature produces such men as
rarely as she does, it seemed only fitting that she should not so
soon deprive us of this one: because it certainly may be said that
messer Cesare was carried off just when he was beginning to
give something more than promise of himself, and to be esteemed
as his admirable qualities deserved; for already, by many meritorious
efforts he had given good proof of his worth, which shone
forth not only in noble birth, but also in the ornament of letters
and of arms, and in every kind of laudable behaviour; so that,
by reason of his goodness, capacity, courage and wisdom, there
was nothing so great that it might not be expected from him.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>No long time passed before the death of messer Roberto da
Bari also inflicted deep sorrow upon the whole court;<a href='#f48' class='c016'><sup>[48]</sup></a> for it
seemed reasonable that everyone should lament the death of a
youth of good behaviour, agreeable, fair of aspect, and of very
rare personal grace, and of as stout and sturdy temper as could
be wished.</p>

<p class='c001'>2.—If, then, these men had lived, I think they would have
reached such eminence that they would have been able to give
everyone who knew them clear proof how worthy the court of
Urbino was of praise, and how adorned with noble cavaliers;
which nearly all the others have done who were reared there.
For verily the Trojan Horse did not send forth so many lords
and captains as this court has sent forth men singular in worth
and most highly prized by everyone. Thus, as you know,
messer Federico Fregoso was made Archbishop of Salerno;
Count Ludovico, Bishop of Bayeux; my lord Ottaviano, Doge
of Genoa; messer Bernardo Bibbiena, Cardinal of Santa Maria
in Portico; messer Pietro Bembo, secretary to Pope Leo; my
lord Magnifico rose to the dukedom of Nemours and to that
greatness where he now is. My lord Francesco Maria della
Rovere also, Prefect of Rome, was made Duke of Urbino:<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c016'><sup>[431]</sup></a>
albeit much higher praise may be accorded to the court where
he was nurtured, because he there became a rare and excellent
lord in every quality of worth, as we now see, than because he
attained the dukedom of Urbino; nor do I believe that a small
cause of this was the noble company in whose daily converse
he always saw and heard laudable behaviour.</p>

<p class='c001'>However, it seems to me that the cause, whether chance or
favour of the stars, which has so long granted excellent lords to
Urbino, still continues and produces the same results; and hence
we may hope that fair fortune must further so bless these good
works, that the welfare of the house and state shall not only not
wane but rather wax from day to day: and of this many bright
auguries are already to be seen, among which I esteem the chief
to be Heaven’s bestowal of such a mistress as is my lady Eleanora
Gonzaga, the new Duchess;<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c016'><sup>[432]</sup></a> for if ever in a single body there
were joined wisdom, grace, beauty, capacity, tact, humanity, and
every other gentle quality,—in her they are so united that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>form a chain which completes and adorns her every movement
with all these qualities at once.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Let us now continue the discussion about our Courtier, in the
hope that after us there ought to be no lack of those who will
find bright and honoured examples of worth in the present court
of Urbino, just as we now do in that of bygone times.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.3'></a>3.—It seemed, then, as my lord Gaspar Pallavicino used to
relate, that the following day after the discussions contained in
the preceding Book, little was seen of my lord Ottaviano; hence
many thought that he had retired in order that he might without
hindrance think carefully of what he had to say. Thus, the
company having betaken themselves to my lady Duchess at the
accustomed hour, search had to be made far and wide for my
lord Ottaviano, who did not appear for a good space; so that
many cavaliers and maids of honour of the court began to dance
and engage in other pastimes, thinking that for that evening
there would be no more talk about the Courtier. And indeed all
were busied, some with one thing and some with another, when
my lord Ottaviano arrived, after he had almost been given up;
and seeing that messer Cesare Gonzaga and my lord Gaspar
were dancing, he bowed to my lady Duchess and said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I quite expected to hear my lord Gaspar say some evil
about women again this evening; but seeing him dance with one,
I think that he has made his peace with all of them; and I am
glad that the dispute (or rather the discussion) about the Courtier
has ended thus.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is by no means ended,” replied my lady Duchess; “for I
am no such enemy of men as you are of women, and therefore I
am unwilling that the Courtier should be deprived of his due
honour, and of those ornaments that you promised him last evening;”
and so saying, she directed that as soon as the dance was
finished, everyone should sit down in the usual order, which was
done; and when all were giving close attention, my lord Ottaviano
said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lady, since my wish to have the Courtier possess many
other good qualities is taken as a promise to tell what they are,
I am content to speak about them, not with any hope of saying
all that might be said, but merely enough to clear your mind of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>the charge that was made against me last evening, to wit: that
I spoke as I did rather for the purpose of detracting from the
Court Lady’s praises (by raising a false belief that other excellences
can be ascribed to the Courtier, and by thus artfully making
him her superior), than because what I said was true.
Wherefore, to adapt myself to the hour, which is later than it is
wont to be when we begin our discussions, I shall be brief.</p>

<p class='c001'>4.—“So, to pursue these gentlemen’s discourse, which I wholly
approve and confirm, I say that of the things that we call good,
there are some which simply and in themselves are always good,
like temperance, fortitude, health, and all the virtues that bestow
tranquillity upon the mind; others, which are good in various
respects and for the object to which they tend, like law, liberality,
riches, and other like things. Hence I think that the perfect
Courtier, such as Count Ludovico and messer Federico have described,
may be a truly good thing and worthy of praise, not
however simply and in himself, but in respect to the end to which
he may be directed. For indeed if by being nobly born, graceful,
agreeable, and expert in so many exercises, the Courtier brought
forth no other fruit than merely being what he is, I should not
deem it right for a man to devote so much study and pains to
acquiring this perfection of Courtiership, as anyone must who
wishes to attain it. Nay, I should say that many of those accomplishments
that have been ascribed to him (like dancing, merry-making,
singing and playing) were follies and vanities, and in a
man of rank worthy rather of censure than of praise: for these
elegances, devices, mottoes, and other like things that pertain to
discourse about women and love, although perhaps many other
men think the contrary, often serve only to effeminate the mind,
to corrupt youth, and to reduce it to great wantonness of living;
whence then it comes to pass that the Italian name is brought
into opprobrium, and but few are to be found who dare, I will
not say to die, but even to run into danger.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And surely there are countless other things, which, if industry
and study were spent upon them, would be of much greater
utility in both peace and war than this kind of Courtiership in
itself merely; but if the Courtier’s actions are directed to that
good end to which they ought, and which I have in mind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>methinks they are not only not harmful or vain, but very useful
and deserving of infinite praise.</p>

<p class='c001'>5.—“I think then that the aim of the perfect Courtier, which
has not been spoken of till now, is so to win for himself, by
means of the accomplishments ascribed to him by these gentlemen,
the favour and mind of the prince whom he serves, that he
may be able to say, and always shall say, the truth about everything
which it is fitting for the prince to know, without fear or
risk of giving offence thereby; and that when he sees his prince’s
mind inclined to do something wrong, he may be quick to oppose,
and gently to make use of the favour acquired by his good
accomplishments, so as to banish every bad intent and lead his
prince into the path of virtue. And thus, possessing the goodness
which these gentlemen have described, together with readiness
of wit and pleasantness, and shrewdness and knowledge of
letters and many other things,—the Courtier will in every case
be able deftly to show the prince how much honour and profit
accrue to him and his from justice, liberality, magnanimity, gentleness,
and the other virtues that become a good prince; and on
the other hand how much infamy and loss proceed from the
vices opposed to them. Therefore I think that just as music,
festivals, games, and the other pleasant accomplishments are as
it were the flower, in like manner to lead or help one’s prince
towards right, and to frighten him from wrong, are the true fruit
of Courtiership.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And since the merit of well-doing lies chiefly in two things,
one of which is the choice of an end for our intentions that shall
be truly good, and the other ability to find means suitable and
fitting to conduce to that good end marked out,—certain it is
that that man’s mind tends to the best end, who purposes to see
to it that his prince shall be deceived by no one, shall hearken not
to flatterers or to slanderers and liars, and shall distinguish good
and evil, and love the one and hate the other.</p>

<p class='c001'>6.—“Methinks, too, that the accomplishments ascribed to the
Courtier by these gentlemen may be a good means of arriving
at that end; and this because among the many faults which
to-day we see in many of our princes, the greatest are ignorance
and self-esteem. And the root of these two evils is none other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>than falsehood: which vice is deservedly hateful to God and to
men, and more injurious to princes than any other; because they
have greatest lack of that whereof they most need to have
abundance—I mean of someone to tell them the truth and to put
them in mind of what is right: for their enemies are not moved
by love to perform these offices, but are well pleased to have
them live wickedly and never correct themselves; on the other
hand, their enemies dare not accuse them openly, for fear of being
punished. Then of their friends there are few who have free
access to them, and those few are chary of censuring them
for their errours as freely as in the case of private persons, and
to win grace and favour often think of nothing but how to
suggest things that may delight and please their fancy, although
the same be evil and dishonourable; thus from being
friends these men become flatterers, and to derive profit from
their intimacy, always speak and act complaisantly, and for the
most part make their way by means of falsehoods, which beget
ignorance in the prince’s mind, not only of outward things but of
himself; and this may be said to be the greatest and most
monstrous falsehood of all, for the ignorant mind deceives itself
and lies inwardly to itself.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.7'></a>7.—“From this it follows that, besides never hearing the truth
about anything whatever, rulers are intoxicated by that licence
which dominion carries with it, and by the abundance of their
enjoyments are drowned in pleasures, and so deceive themselves
and have their minds so corrupted,—always finding themselves
obeyed and almost adored with such reverence and praise, without
the least censure or even contradiction,—that from this
ignorance they pass to boundless self-esteem, so that they then
brook no advice or persuasion from others. And since they
think that to know how to rule is a very easy thing, and that to
succeed therein they need no other art or training than mere
force, they bend their mind and all their thoughts to the maintenance
of that power which they have, esteeming that true
felicity lies in being able to do what one likes.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore some princes hate reason and justice, thinking that
it would be a kind of bridle and a means of reducing them to
bondage, and of lessening the pleasure and satisfaction which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>they have in ruling, if they were willing to follow it; and that
their dominion would not be perfect or complete if they were
constrained to obey duty and honour, because they think that he
who obeys is no true ruler. Therefore, following these principles
and allowing themselves to be transported by self-esteem, they
become arrogant, with haughty looks and stern behaviour, with
splendid dress, gold and gems, and by letting themselves be
almost never seen in public they think to win authority among
men and to be held almost as gods. And to my thinking they
are like the colossi that last year were made at Rome the day of
the festival in the Piazza d’Agone,<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c016'><sup>[433]</sup></a> which outwardly showed
a likeness to great men and horses in a triumph, and within
were full of tow and rags. But princes of this sort are much
worse, in that the colossi keep upright merely by their great
weight; while the princes, since they are ill balanced within and
placed haphazard on uneven bases, fall to their ruin by reason
of their own weight, and from one errour run into many; for
their ignorance, together with the false belief that they cannot
err and that the power which they have proceeds from their
own wisdom, leads them to seize states boldly by fair means or
foul, whenever they can.</p>

<p class='c001'>8.—“But if they were resolved to know and to do that which
they ought, they would be as set on not ruling as they are set
on ruling; for they would perceive how monstrous and pernicious
a thing it is when subjects, who are to be governed, are
wiser than the princes who are to govern.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You see that ignorance of music, of dancing, of horsemanship,
is not harmful to any man; nevertheless, he who is no
musician is ashamed and dares not sing in the presence of
others, or dance if he knows not how, or ride if he has not a
good seat. But from not knowing how to govern people there
spring so many woes, deaths, destructions, burnings, ruins,—that
it may be said to be the deadliest pest that is to be found on
earth. And yet some princes who are very ignorant of government
are not ashamed to undertake to govern, I will not say
in the presence of four or of six men, but before all the world, for
their rank is set so high that all eyes gaze on them, and hence
not only their great but their least defects are always noted.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>Thus it is written that Cimon was accused of loving wine, Scipio
of loving sleep, Lucullus of loving feasts.<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c016'><sup>[434]</sup></a> But would to God
that the princes of our time might couple their sins with as
many virtues as did those ancients; who, although they erred in
some respects, yet did not avoid the reminders and advice
of anyone who seemed to them competent to correct those
errours, but rather sought with all solicitude to order their lives
after the precepts of excellent men: as Epaminondas after that
of Lysis the Pythagorean,<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c016'><sup>[435]</sup></a> Agesilaus after that of Xenophon,
Scipio after that of Panætius, and countless others.<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c016'><sup>[436]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“But if some of our princes were to happen upon a stern
philosopher or any man who was willing openly and artlessly to
show them the frightful face of true virtue, and to teach them
what good behaviour is and what a good prince’s life ought to
be, I am certain that they would loathe him like an asp, or in
sooth deride him as a thing most vile.</p>

<p class='c001'>9.—“I say, then, that since princes are to-day so corrupted by
evil customs and by ignorance and mistaken self-esteem, and
since it is so difficult to give them knowledge of the truth and
lead them on to virtue, and since men seek to enter into their
favour by lies and flatteries and such vicious means,—the Courtier,
by the aid of those gentle qualities that Count Ludovico and
messer Federico have given him, can with ease and should try
to gain the good will and so charm the mind of his prince, that
he shall win free and safe indulgence to speak of everything
without being irksome. And if he be such as has been said, he
will accomplish this with little trouble, and thus be able always
to disclose the truth about all things with ease; and also to instil
goodness into his prince’s mind little by little, and to teach continence,
fortitude, justice, temperance, by giving a taste of how
much sweetness is hidden by the little bitterness that at first
sight appears to him who withstands vice; which is always
hurtful and displeasing, and accompanied by infamy and blame,
just as virtue is profitable, blithe and full of praise. And thereto
he will be able to incite his prince by the example of the famous
captains and other eminent men to whom the ancients were
wont to make statues of bronze and of marble and sometimes of
gold, and to erect the same in public places, both for the honour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>of these men and as a stimulus to others, so that they might
be led by worthy emulation to strive to reach that glory too.</p>

<p class='c001'>10.—“In this way the Courtier will be able to lead his prince
along the thorny path of virtue, decking it as with shady leafage
and strewing it with lovely flowers to relieve the tedium of the
weary journey to one whose strength is slight; and now with
music, now with arms and horses, now with verses, now with
love talk, and with all those means whereof these gentlemen
have told, to keep his mind continually busied with worthy
pleasures, yet always impressing upon him also, as I have said,
some virtuous practice along with these allurements, and playing
upon him with salutary craft; like cunning doctors, who
often anoint the edge of the cup with a sweet cordial, when they
wish to give some bitter-tasting medicine to sick and over-delicate
children.</p>

<p class='c001'>“If, therefore, the Courtier put the veil of pleasure to such
a use, he will reach his aim in every time and place and exercise,
and will deserve much greater praise and reward than for
any other good work that he could do in the world. For there is
no good thing that is of such universal advantage as a good
prince, nor any evil so universally noxious as a bad prince:
hence, too, there is no punishment so harsh and cruel as to be a
sufficient penalty for those wicked courtiers who use their gentle
and pleasant ways and fine accomplishments to a bad end, and
therewith seek their prince’s favour, in order to corrupt him and
entice him from the path of virtue and lead him into vice; for
such as these may be said to taint with deadly poison not a
single cup from which one man alone must drink, but the public
fountain used by all men.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.11'></a>11.—My lord Ottaviano was silent, as if he did not wish to say
more; but my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It does not seem to me, my lord Ottaviano, that this right-mindedness
and continence, and the other virtues which you wish
the Courtier to show his lord, can be learned; but I think that
the men who have them are given them by nature and by God.
And that this is true, you see that there is no man in the world
so wicked and ill conditioned, or so intemperate and perverse, as
to confess that he is so when he is asked; nay, everyone, however
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>wicked he be, has pleasure in being deemed just, continent
and good: which would not be the case if these virtues could be
learned; for it is no disgrace not to know that to which one has
given no study, but it seems a reproach indeed not to have that
wherewith we ought to be adorned by nature. Hence everyone
tries to hide his natural defects both of mind and of body too;
which is seen in the blind, the halt and the crooked, and in
others who are maimed or ugly; for although these imperfections
may be ascribed to nature, still everyone dislikes to be sensible
of them in himself, because he seems by nature’s own testimony
to have that defect as it were for a seal and token of his wickedness.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Moreover my opinion is confirmed by that story which is
told of Epimetheus, who knew so ill how to distribute the gifts
of nature among men that he left them much poorer in everything
than all other creatures: wherefore Prometheus stole from
Minerva and from Vulcan that artful cunning whereby men find
the means of living;<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c016'><sup>[437]</sup></a> but still they did not have the civic cunning
to gather together in cities and live orderly lives, for this was
guarded in Jove’s castle by very watchful warders, who so
frightened Prometheus that he dared not approach them; wherefore
Jove had compassion for the misery of men, who were torn
by wild beasts because they could not stand together for lack of
civic faculty, and sent Mercury to earth to bring them justice
and shame, to the end that these two things might adorn their
cities and unite the citizens. And he saw fit that they should
not be given to men like the other arts, wherein one expert suffices
for many ignorant (as in the case of medicine), but that
they should be impressed upon each man; and he ordained a
law that all who were without justice and shame should be exterminated
and put to death like public pests. So you see, my
lord Ottaviano, that these virtues are vouchsafed by God to men,
and are not acquired, but natural.”</p>

<p class='c001'>12.—Then my lord Ottaviano said, smiling:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you then insist, my lord Gaspar, that men are so unhappy
and perverse, that they have by industry discovered an art to
tame the natures of wild beasts, bears, wolves, lions, and by it
are able to teach a pretty bird to fly whither they like, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>return willingly from its woods and natural freedom to cages
and captivity,—and yet that they cannot or will not by the same
industry find arts to help themselves and improve their minds
with diligence and study? To my thinking this would be as if
physicians were to study with all diligence to acquire the mere
art of healing sore nails and scurf in children, and were to leave
off curing fevers, pleurisy and other serious maladies; and how
out of all reason this would be, everyone can consider.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore I think that the moral virtues are not in us by
nature wholly, for nothing can ever become used to that which
is naturally contrary to it; as we see in the case of a stone,
which although it were thrown upwards ten thousand times
would never become used to move thither of itself; hence if
virtue were as natural to us as weight is to the stone, we should
never become used to vice. Nor, on the other hand, are the vices
natural in this sense, for we should never be able to be virtuous;
and it would be too unfair and foolish to chastise men for those
defects that proceed from nature without our fault; and this errour
would be committed by the law, which does not inflict punishment
upon malefactors on account of their past errour (since
what is done can not be undone), but has regard to the future, to
the end that he who has erred may err no more nor be the cause
of others erring through his bad example. And thus the law
presumes that the virtues can be learned, which is very true;
for we are born capable of receiving them and the vices also,
and hence custom creates in us the habit of both the one and the
other, so that we first practise virtue or vice, and then are virtuous
or vicious.</p>

<p class='c001'>“The contrary is observed in things that are bestowed by nature,
which we first have the power to practise and then do
practise: as is the case with the senses; for first we are able to
see, hear and touch, then we see, hear and touch, although also
many of these functions are perfected by training. Wherefore
good masters teach children not only letters, but also good and
seemly manners in eating, drinking, speaking and walking, with
certain appropriate gestures.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.13'></a>13.—“Therefore as in the other arts, so too in virtue it is necessary
to have a master, who by instruction and good reminders
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>shall arouse and awake in us those moral virtues whereof we
have the seed enclosed and buried in our soul, and like a good
husbandman shall cultivate them and open the way for them by
freeing us from the thorns and tares of appetite, which often so
overshadow and choke our minds as not to let them blossom or
bring forth those happy fruits which alone we should desire to
have spring up in the human heart.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In this sense, then, justice and shame, which you say Jove
sent upon earth to all men, are natural in each one of us. But
just as a body without eyes, however strong it be, often fails if it
moves towards any object, so the root of these virtues potentially
engendered in our minds often comes to naught if it be not
helped by cultivation. For if it is to ripen into action and perfect
character, nature alone is not enough, as has been said, but
there is need of studied practice and of reason, to purify and
clear the soul by lifting the dark veil of ignorance, from which
nearly all the errours of men proceed,—because if good and evil
were well perceived and understood, everyone would always
prefer good and shun evil. Thus virtue may almost be said to be
a kind of prudence and wit to prefer the good, and vice a kind of
imprudence and ignorance which lead us to judge falsely; for
men never prefer evil deeming it to be evil, but are deceived by
a certain likeness that it bears to good.”</p>

<p class='c001'>14.—Then my lord Gaspar replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are, however, many who know well that they are doing
evil, and yet do it; and this because they have more thought for
the present pleasure which they feel, than for the chastisement
which they fear must come upon them: like thieves, homicides,
and other such men.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Ottaviano said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“True pleasure is always good, and true suffering always evil;
therefore these men deceive themselves in taking false pleasure
for true, and true suffering for false; hence by false pleasures
they often run into true sufferings. Therefore that art which
teaches how to discern the true from the false, may well be
learned; and the faculty whereby we choose that which is truly
good and not that which falsely seems so, may be called true
wisdom and more profitable to human life than any other,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>because it dispels the ignorance from which, as I have said, all
evils spring.”</p>

<p class='c001'>15.—Then messer Pietro Bembo said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not know, my lord Ottaviano, whether my lord Gaspar
ought to grant you that all evils spring from ignorance; and that
there are not many who well know that they are sinning when
they sin, and do not in the least deceive themselves as to true
pleasure, nor yet as to true suffering. For it is certain that those
who are incontinent judge reasonably and rightly, and know that
to be evil to which they are prompted by their lusts in spite
of duty, and therefore resist and set reason against appetite,
whence arises a conflict of pleasure and pain against judgment.
Conquered at last by too potent appetite, reason yields, like
a ship which resists awhile the buffetings of the sea, but finally
beaten by the too furious violence of the gale, with anchor and
rigging broken, suffers herself to be driven at fortune’s will,
without use of helm or any guidance of compass to save her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore the incontinent commit their errours with a certain
doubtful remorse, and as it were in their own despite; which
they would not do if they did not know that what they are doing
is evil, but would follow appetite without restraint of reason and
wholly uncontrolled, and would then be not incontinent but
intemperate, which is much worse. Thus incontinence is said to
be a diminished vice, because it has a grain of reason in it; and
likewise continence is said to be an imperfect virtue, because it
has a grain of passion in it. Therefore in this, methinks, we
cannot say that the errours of the incontinent proceed from
ignorance, or that they deceive themselves and that they do not
sin, when they well know that they are sinning.”</p>

<p class='c001'>16.—My lord Ottaviano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“In truth, messer Pietro, your argument is fine; yet to my
thinking it is specious rather than sound, for although the incontinent
sin hesitatingly, and reason struggles with appetite in
their mind, and although that which is evil seems evil to them,—yet
they have no perfect perception of it, nor do they know it so
thoroughly as they need. Hence they have a vague idea rather
than any certain knowledge of it, and thus allow their reason to
be overcome by passion; but if they had true knowledge of it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>doubtless they would not err: since the thing by which appetite
conquers reason is always ignorance, and true knowledge can
never be overcome by passion, which is derived from the body
and not from the mind, and becomes virtue if rightly ruled and
governed by reason; if not, it becomes vice.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But reason has such power that it always reduces the senses
to submission and enters in by wonderful means and ways, provided
ignorance does not seize that which it ought to possess.
So that although the spirits and nerves and bones have no
reason in them, yet when a movement of the mind starts in us,
as if thought were spurring and shaking the bridle on our
spirits, all our members make ready,—the feet to run, the hands
to take or to do that which the mind thinks; and moreover this
is clearly seen in many who at times unwittingly eat some loathsome
and disgusting food, which to their taste seems very
delicious, and then learning what thing it was, not only suffer
pain and distress of mind, but the body so follows the mental
sense, that they must perforce cast up that food.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.17'></a>17.—My lord Ottaviano was continuing his discourse further, but
the Magnifico Giuliano interrupted him and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“If I heard aright, my lord Ottaviano, you said that continence
is an imperfect virtue because it has a grain of passion in it; and
when there is a struggle waging in our minds between reason and
appetite, I think that the virtue which battles and gives reason the
victory, ought to be esteemed more perfect than that which conquers
without opposition of lust or passion; for there the mind
seems not to abstain from evil by force of virtue, but to refrain
from doing evil because it has no inclination thereto.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lord Ottaviano said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Which captain would you deem of greater worth, the one who
fighting openly puts himself in danger and yet conquers the
enemy, or the one who by his ability and skill deprives them of
their strength, reducing them to such straits that they cannot
fight, and thus conquers them without any battle or danger whatever?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The one,” said the Magnifico Giuliano, “who more safely conquers
is without doubt more to be praised, provided this safe victory
of his do not proceed from the cowardice of the enemy.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>My lord Ottaviano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have judged rightly; and hence I tell you that continence
may be likened to a captain who fights manfully, and although
the enemy be strong and powerful, still conquers them, albeit
not without great difficulty and danger. While temperance
unperturbed is like that captain who conquers and rules without
opposition, and having not only abated but quite extinguished the
fire of lust in the mind where she abides, like a good prince in
time of civil strife, she destroys her seditious enemies within, and
gives reason the sceptre and whole dominion.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus this virtue does not compel the mind, but infusing it by
very gentle means with a vehement belief that inclines it to righteousness,
renders it calm and full of rest, in all things equal and
well measured, and disposed on every side by a certain self-accord
which adorns it with a tranquillity so serene that it is never
ruffled, and becomes in all things very obedient to reason and
ready to turn its every act thereto and to follow wherever reason
may wish to lead it, without the least unwillingness; like a tender
lambkin, which always runs and stops and walks near its dam,
and moves only with her.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This virtue, then, is very perfect and especially befitting to
princes, because from it spring many others.”</p>

<p class='c001'>18.—Then messer Cesare Gonzaga said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not know what virtues befitting to a lord can spring from
this temperance, if it is the one which removes the passions from
the mind, as you say. Perhaps this would be fitting in a monk or
hermit; but I am by no means sure whether it would befit a prince
(who was magnanimous, liberal and valiant in arms) never to feel,
whatever might be done to him, either wrath or hate or good will
or scorn or lust or passion of any kind, and whether he could
without this wield authority over citizens or soldiers.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Ottaviano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I did not say that temperance wholly removes and uproots the
passions from the human mind, nor would it be well to do this, for
even the passions contain some elements of good; but it reduces to
the sway of reason that which is perverse in our passions and recusant
to right. Therefore it is not well to extirpate the passions
altogether, in order to be rid of disturbance; for this would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>like making an edict that no one must drink wine, in order to be
rid of drunkenness, or forbidding everyone to run, because in running
we sometimes fall. You know that those who tame horses
do not keep them from running and leaping, but would have them
do so seasonably and in obedience to the rider.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus, when moderated by temperance, the passions are helpful
to virtue, like the wrath that aids strength, hatred of evil-doers
aids justice, and likewise the other virtues are aided by the passions;
which, if they were wholly removed, would leave the reason
very weak and languid, so that it could effect little, like the master
of a vessel abandoned by the winds in a great calm.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now do not marvel, messer Cesare, if I have said that many
other virtues are born of temperance, for when a mind is attuned
to this harmony, it then through the reason easily receives true
strength, which makes it bold, and safe from every peril, and
almost superior to human passions. Nor is this less true of justice
(unspotted virgin, friend of modesty and good, queen of all the
other virtues), because she teaches us to do that which it is right to
do, and to shun that which it is right to shun; and therefore she
is most perfect, because the other virtues perform their works
through her, and because she is helpful to whomsoever possesses
her, both to himself and to others: without whom (as it is said) Jove
himself could not rule his kingdom rightly. Magnanimity also follows
these and enhances them all; but she cannot stand alone, for
whoever has no other virtue, cannot be magnanimous. Then the
guide of these virtues is foresight, which consists in a certain
judgment in choosing well. And in this happy chain are joined
liberality, magnificence, thirst for honour, gentleness, pleasantness,
affability and many others which there is not now time to
name.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But if our Courtier will do that which we have said, he will
find them all in his prince’s mind, and will daily see spring therefrom
beautiful flowers and fruits, such as all the delightful gardens
in the world do not contain; and he will feel within him
very great content when he remembers that he gave his prince,
not that which fools give (which is gold or silver, vases, raiment,
and the like, whereof the giver has very great dearth, and the
recipient very great abundance), but that faculty which of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>things human is perhaps the greatest and rarest—that is, the
manner and mode of ruling and reigning rightly: which would
of itself alone suffice to make men happy and to bring back once
more to earth that age of gold which is said to have been when
Saturn reigned.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.19'></a>19.—My lord Ottaviano having here made a little pause as if to
rest, my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Which do you think, my lord Ottaviano, the happier rule,
and the more able to bring back to earth that age of gold which
you have mentioned,—the rule of so good a prince, or the government
of a good republic?”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Ottaviano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should always prefer the rule of a good prince, because
such dominion is more accordant with nature, and (if it is allowed
to compare small things with infinitely great) more like that of
God, who governs the universe singly and alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But leaving this aside, you see that in those things that are
wrought by human skill,—such as armies, great fleets, buildings
and the like,—the whole is referred to one man who governs to
his liking. So too in our body all the members labour and are
employed at the command of the heart. Moreover it seems fitting
that the people should be ruled by one prince, as is the case
also with many animals, to whom nature teaches this obedience
as a very salutary thing. You know that stags, cranes and many
other birds, when on their flight, always set up a leader, whom
they follow and obey; and the bees obey their king as it were by
process of reason, and with as much reverence as the most
obedient people on earth; and hence all this is very strong proof
that the dominion of princes is more accordant with nature than
that of republics.”</p>

<p class='c001'>20.—Then messer Pietro Bembo said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yet it seems to me that since liberty has been given us by
God as a supreme gift, it is not reasonable that we should be deprived
of it, nor that one man should have a larger share of it
than another: which happens under the dominion of princes,
who for the most part hold their subjects in closest bondage.
But in rightly ordered republics this liberty is fully preserved:
besides which, both in judgments and in councils, it more often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>happens that one man’s opinion singly is wrong, than that of
many; because disturbance arising from anger or scorn or lust
more easily enters the mind of one man than that of the many,
who are almost like a great body of water, which is less liable
to corruption than a small one.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I say, too, that the example of the animals does not seem to
me apposite; for stags, cranes and the rest do not always set up
the same one to follow and obey, but on the contrary change and
vary, giving the dominion over them now to one, now to another,
and thus come to be a kind of republic rather than a monarchy;
and this may be called true and equal liberty, when those who
command to-day in turn obey to-morrow. Neither does the example
of the bees seem to me pertinent, for that king of theirs is
not of their own species; and therefore whoever would give men
a truly worthy lord, would need to find one of another species
and of more excellent nature than that of men, if men must of
reason obey him, like the herds which obey not an animal of
their own kind but a herdsman, who is a man and of higher
species than theirs.</p>

<p class='c001'>“For these reasons, my lord Ottaviano, I think the rule of a
republic is more desirable than that of a king.”</p>

<p class='c001'>21.—Then my lord Ottaviano said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Against your opinion, messer Pietro, I wish to cite only one
argument; which is, that of the modes of ruling people well,
three kinds only are to be found: one is monarchy; another, the
rule of the good, whom the ancients called optimates; the other,
popular government. And the excess and opposite extreme, so
to speak, wherein each one of the forms of rule falls to ruin and
decay, is when monarchy becomes tyranny; and when the rule
of the optimates changes to government by a few powerful and
bad men; and when popular government is seized by the rabble,
which breaks down distinctions and commits the government
of the whole to the caprice of the multitude. Of these three
kinds of bad government, it is certain that tyranny is the worst
of all, as could be proved by many arguments; then it follows
that monarchy is the best of the three kinds of good government,
because it is the opposite of the worst; for, as you know, the
results of opposite causes are themselves opposite.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>“Now as to what you said about liberty, I reply that we ought
not to say that true liberty is to live as we like, but to live according
to good laws. Nor is it less natural and useful and
necessary to obey than it is to command; and some things are
born and thus appointed and ordained by nature to command, as
certain others are to obey. True it is that there are two modes
of ruling: the one imperious and violent, like that of masters
towards their slaves, and in this way the soul commands the
body; the other more mild and gentle, like that of good princes
by means of laws over their subjects, and in this way the reason
commands the appetite: and both of these modes are useful, for
the body is by nature created apt for obedience to the soul, and
so is appetite for obedience to reason. Moreover there are
many men whose actions have to do only with the use of the
body; and such as these are as far from virtuous as the soul
from the body, and although they are rational creatures, they
have only such share of reason as to recognize it but not to
possess or profit by it. These, therefore, are naturally slaves, and
it is better and more profitable for them to obey than to command.”</p>

<p class='c001'>22.—Thereupon my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“In what mode then are the discreet and virtuous, and those
who are not by nature slaves, to be ruled?”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Ottaviano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“With that gentle rule, kingly and civic. And to such men it
is well sometimes to give the charge of those offices for which
they are fitted, to the end that they too may be able to command
and govern those less wise than themselves, but in such manner
that the chief rule shall wholly depend upon the supreme prince.
And since you said that it is an easier thing for the mind of one
man to be corrupted than for that of many, I say that it is also
an easier thing to find one good and wise man than many. And
to be good and wise ought to be deemed possible for a king
of noble race, inclined to worthiness by his natural instinct and
by the illustrious memory of his predecessors, and practised in
good behaviour; and if he be not of another species more than
human (as you said of the bee-king), being aided by the teachings
and by the education and skill of so prudent and excellent a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>Courtier as these gentlemen have described,—he will be very
just, continent, temperate, strong and wise, full of liberality,
magnificence, religion and clemency. In short, he will be very
glorious, and very dear to men and to God (by whose grace he will
attain that heroic worth which will make him exceed the limits of
humanity), and may be called a demigod rather than a mortal man.</p>

<p class='c001'>“For God delights in and protects, not those princes who wish
to imitate Him by displaying great power and making themselves
adored of men, but those who, besides the power that makes
them mighty, strive to make themselves like Him in goodness
and wisdom, whereby they wish and are able to do good and to
be His ministers, distributing for men’s weal the benefits and
gifts which they receive from Him. Thus, just as in heaven the
sun and moon and other stars show the world as in a mirrour
some likeness of God, so on earth a much liker image of God is
found in those good princes who love and revere Him, and show
their people the shining light of His justice and a reflection
of His divine reason and mind; and with such as these God
shares His righteousness, equity, justice and goodness, and those
other happy blessings which I know not how to name, but which
display to the world much clearer proof of divinity than the sun’s
light, or the continual revolving of the heavens and the various
coursing of the stars.</p>

<p class='c001'>23.—“Accordingly men have been placed by God under the
ward of princes, who for this reason ought to take diligent care
of them, in order to render Him an account of them like good
stewards to their lord, and ought to love them, and regard
as personal to themselves every good and evil thing that happens
to them, and provide for their happiness above every other
thing. Therefore the prince ought not only to be good, but also
to make others good, like that square used by architects, which
not only is straight and true itself, but also makes straight
and true all things to which it is applied. And a very great
proof that the prince is good is when his people are good,
because the prince’s life is law and preceptress to his subjects,
and upon his behaviour all the others must needs depend; nor is
it fitting for an ignorant man to teach, nor for an unordered man
to give orders, nor for one who falls to raise up others.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>“Hence if the prince would perform these duties rightly, he
must devote every study and diligence to wisdom; then he must
set before himself and follow steadfastly in everything the law
of reason (unwritten on paper or metal, but graven upon his own
mind), to the end that it may be not only familiar to him, but ingrained
in him, and abide with him as a part of himself; so that
day and night, in every place and time, it may admonish him and
speak inwardly to his heart, freeing him from those disturbances
that are felt by intemperate minds, which—because they are
oppressed on the one hand as it were by the very deep sleep of
ignorance, and on the other by the travail which they suffer from
their perverse and blind desires—are tossed by relentless fury,
as a sleeper sometimes is by strange and dreadful visions.</p>

<p class='c001'>24.—“Moreover, by adding greater power to evil wish, greater
harm is added also; and when the prince is able to do that which
he wishes, then there is great danger that he will not wish that
which he ought. Hence Bias well said that office shows what
men are:<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c016'><sup>[438]</sup></a> for just as vases with some crack in them cannot
easily be detected so long as they are empty, yet if liquid be
poured in they at once show where the flaw is;—so corrupt and
vicious minds seldom disclose their defects except when they are
filled with authority; because then they do not suffice to bear the
heavy weight of power, and hence run all lengths and scatter on
every side the greeds, the pride, the bad temper, the insolence,
and those tyrannical practices, which they have within them.
Thus they recklessly persecute the good and wise and exalt the
wicked, and in their cities they permit neither friendships nor
unions nor understandings among their subjects, but maintain
spies, informers and murderers, in order that they may frighten
and make men cowardly, and sow discords to keep men disunited
and weak. And from these ways there then ensue countless ruin
and losses to the unhappy people, and often cruel death (or at
least continual fear) to the tyrants themselves; because good
princes are not afraid for themselves, but for those whom they
rule, while tyrants fear even those whom they rule; hence the
greater the number of people they rule and the more powerful
they are, so much the more do they fear and so many more
enemies do they have.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>“How frightened and of what uneasy mind do you think was
Clearchus, tyrant of Pontus,<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c016'><sup>[439]</sup></a> every time he went into the market-place
or theatre, or to a banquet or other public place? who, as
it is written, was wont to sleep shut up in a chest. Or that other
tyrant, Aristodemus the Argive?<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c016'><sup>[440]</sup></a> who made a kind of prison of
his bed: for in his palace he had a little room hung in air, and
so high that it could be reached only by a ladder; and here he
slept with one of his women, whose mother took away the ladder
at night and replaced it in the morning.</p>

<p class='c001'>“A wholly different life from this, then, ought that of the good
prince to be, free and safe and as dear to his subjects as their
very own, and so ordered as to partake both of the active and
of the contemplative, as much as may comport with his people’s
weal.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.25'></a>25.—Then my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“And which of these two lives, my lord Ottaviano, seems to
you more fitting for the prince?”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Ottaviano replied, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perhaps you think I imagine myself to be that excellent
Courtier who ought to know so many things and apply them to
that good end which I have set forth; but remember that these
gentlemen have described him with many accomplishments that
are not in me. Therefore let us first take care to find him, for I
leave to him both this and all things else that belong to a good
prince.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think that if any of the accomplishments ascribed to the
Courtier are lacking in you, they are music and dancing and
others of small importance, rather than those that belong to the
moulding of the prince and to this end of Courtiership.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Ottaviano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“None of those are of small importance that help to win the
prince’s favour, which is necessary (as we have said) before the
Courtier risks trying to teach him virtue; which I think I have
proved can be learned, and in which there is as much profit as
there is loss in ignorance, whence spring all sins, and especially
that false esteem which men cherish of themselves. But methinks
I have said enough, and perhaps more than I promised.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>Then my lady Duchess said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“We shall be the more beholden to your courtesy, the more
your performance outstrips your promise; so do not weary of
saying what occurs to you about my lord Gaspar’s question; and
by your faith, tell us also everything that you would teach your
prince if he had need of instruction, and imagine yourself to have
won completely his favour, so that you are allowed to tell him
freely what comes into your mind.”</p>

<p class='c001'>26.—My lord Ottaviano laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“If I had the favour of a certain prince whom I know, and were
to tell him freely what I think, I fear that I should soon lose it;
moreover, to teach him, I myself should first need to learn.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yet since it pleases you to have me answer my lord Gaspar
further concerning this, I say that I think princes ought to lead
both the two lives, but more especially the contemplative life, because
in their case this is divided into two parts: one of which consists
in perceiving rightly and in judging; the other in commanding
(justly and in those ways that are fitting) things reasonable
and those wherein they have authority, and in requiring the same
of such men as have in reason to obey, and at appropriate times
and places; and of this Duke Federico spoke when he said that
whoever knows how to command is always obeyed. And as
command is always the chief office of princes, they ought often
to see with their own eyes and be present at the execution of
their commands, and ought also sometimes to take part themselves,
according to the time and need; and all this partakes of
action: but the aim of the active life ought to be the contemplative,
as peace is that of war, repose that of toil.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.27'></a>27.—“Therefore it is also the good prince’s office so to establish
his people, and under such laws and ordinances, that they
may live at ease and peace, without danger and with dignity, and
may worthily enjoy this end of their actions, which ought to be
tranquillity. For many republics and princes are often found that
have been very prosperous and great in war, and as soon as they
have had peace they have gone to ruin and lost their greatness
and splendour, like iron laid aside. And this has come about
from nothing else but from their not having been well established
for living at peace, and from their not knowing how to enjoy the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>blessing of ease. And to be always at war, without seeking to
arrive at the end of peace, is not permitted: albeit some princes
think that their chief aim ought to be to lord it over their neighbours;
and therefore they train their people to a warlike ferocity
for spoil, killing and the like, and give rewards to excite it, and
call it virtue.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus it was once a custom among the Scythians that whoever
had not slain an enemy might not drink from the bowl which
was handed about to the company at solemn feasts. In other
places they used to set up, around a tomb, as many obelisks as he
who was buried there had slain enemies; and all these things
were done to make men warlike, solely in order to lord it over
others: which was almost impossible, because the undertaking
was endless (until the whole world should be subjugated) and far
from reasonable according to the law of nature, which will not
have us pleased with that in others which is displeasing to us in
ourselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore princes ought not to make their people warlike for
lust of rule, but for the sake of being able to defend themselves
and their people against him who would reduce them to bondage
or do them wrong in any wise; or to drive out tyrants and govern
those people well who were ill used, or to reduce to bondage
those who are by nature such as to deserve being made slaves,
with the object of governing them well and giving them ease and
rest and peace. To this end also the laws and all the ordinances
of justice ought to be directed, by punishing the wicked, not from
hatred, but in order that they may not be wicked and to the end
that they may not disturb the tranquillity of the good. For in
truth it is a monstrous thing and worthy of blame for men to show
themselves valiant and wise in war (which is bad in itself) and in
peace and quiet (which are good) to show themselves ignorant
and of so little worth that they know not how to enjoy their happiness.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hence, just as in war men ought to apply themselves to the
qualities that are useful and necessary to attain its end, which
is peace,—so in peace, to attain its end also, which is tranquillity,
they ought to apply themselves to the righteous qualities that are
the end of the useful. And thus subjects will be good, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>prince will have much more to praise and reward than to punish;
and dominion will be very happy for the subjects and for the
prince—not imperious, like that of master over slave, but sweet
and gentle, like that of a good father over a good son.”</p>

<p class='c001'>28.—Then my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should much like to know what these virtues are that are
useful and necessary in war, and what ones are righteous in
peace.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Ottaviano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“All virtues are good and helpful, because they tend to a good
end; but of especial utility in war is that true courage which so
frees the mind from the passions that it not only fears not dangers,
but even pays no heed to them; likewise steadfastness, and that
enduring patience, with a mind staunch and undisturbed by all
the shocks of fortune. It is also fitting in war, and always, to have
all the virtues that make for right,—like justice, continence,
temperance; but much more in time of peace and ease, because
men placed in prosperity and ease, when good fortune smiles upon
them, often become unjust, intemperate, and allow themselves to
be corrupted by pleasures: hence those who are in such case
have very great need of these virtues, for ease too readily engenders
evil behaviour in human minds. Therefore it was anciently
said as a proverb, slaves should be given no ease; and it is believed
that the pyramids of Egypt were made to keep the people
busy, because it is very good for everyone to be accustomed to
bear toil.</p>

<p class='c001'>“There are still many other virtues that are all helpful, but let
it suffice for the present that I have spoken until now; for if I
knew how to teach my prince and instruct him in this kind of
worthy education such as we have planned, merely by so doing
I should deem myself to have attained sufficiently well the aim
of the good Courtier.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.29'></a>29.—Then my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My lord Ottaviano, since you have highly praised good education,
and seemed almost to think that it is the chief means of
making a man virtuous and good, I should like to know whether
this instruction, which the Courtier must give his prince, ought
to be begun with practice and with daily behaviour as it were,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>so as to accustom him to right doing without his perceiving it; or
whether a beginning ought to be made by demonstrating to his
reason the quality of good and evil, and by making him understand,
before he sets out, which is the good way and the one to
follow, and which is the bad way and the one to avoid: in short
whether his mind ought to be first imbued and implanted with
the virtues through the reason and intelligence or through
practice.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Ottaviano said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You start me upon too long a discourse; still, in order that
you may not think I abstain from lack of will to answer your
questions, I say that just as our mind and body are two things,
so too the soul is divided into two parts, of which one has the
reason in it, and the other has the appetite. Then, just as in
generation the body precedes the soul, so the unreasoning part
of the soul precedes the reasoning part: which is clearly perceived
in children, in whom anger and lust are seen almost as
soon as they are born, but with the lapse of time reason appears.
Hence care must be taken of the body earlier than of the soul,
and of appetite earlier than of reason; but care of the body with
a view to the soul, and of the appetite with a view to reason: for
just as intellectual worth is perfected by instruction, so is moral
worth perfected by practice. We ought, therefore, first to teach
through habit, which is able to govern the as yet unreasoning
appetites and to direct them towards the good by means of that
fair use; next we ought to establish them through the understanding,
which, although it shows its light more tardily, still
furnishes a mode of making the virtues more perfectly fruitful to
one whose mind is well trained by practice,—wherein, to my
thinking, lies the whole matter.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.30'></a>30.—My lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Before you go further, I should like to know what care ought
to be taken of the body, since you said that we ought to take
care of it earlier than of the soul.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“As to that,” replied my lord Ottaviano, laughing, “ask those
who nourish their bodies well, and are plump and fresh; for
mine, as you see, is not too well conditioned. Yet of this also it
would be possible to say much, as of the proper time for marriage,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>to the end that the children may not be too near or too far
from their father’s age; of the exercises and education to be followed
from birth and during the rest of life, in order to make
them handsome, strong and sturdy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Gaspar replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“That which would best please women for making their children
handsome and beautiful, methinks would be that community
wherein Plato in his Republic wishes them to be held, and
after that manner.”<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c016'><sup>[441]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lady Emilia said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is not in the compact that you should fall to speaking ill
of women again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think,” replied my lord Gaspar, “that I give them great
praise in saying that they wish to bring in a custom approved
by so great a man.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Cesare Gonzaga said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let us see whether this could have place among my lord
Ottaviano’s precepts (I do not know if he has rehearsed them
all), and whether it were well for the prince to make it law.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The few that I have rehearsed,” replied my lord Ottaviano,
“might perhaps suffice to make a prince good, as princes go
nowadays; although if one cared to look into the matter more
minutely, he would still have much more to say.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lady Duchess added:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Since it costs us nothing but words, tell us on your faith
everything that it would occur to your mind to teach your prince.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.31'></a>31.—My lord Ottaviano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Many other things, my Lady, would I teach him, provided I
knew them; and among others, that he should choose from his
subjects a number of the noblest and wisest gentlemen, with
whom he should consult on everything, and that he should give
them authority and free leave to speak their mind to him about
all things without ceremony; and that he should preserve such
demeanour towards them, that they all might perceive that
he wished to know the truth about everything and held all manner
of falsehood in hatred. Besides this council of nobles, I
should advise that there be chosen from the people other men of
lower rank, of whom a popular council should be made, to communicate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>with the council of nobles concerning the affairs of the
city, both public and private. And in this way there would be
made of the prince (as of the head) and of the nobles and commonalty
(as of the members) a single united body, the government
of which would spring chiefly from the prince and yet
include the others also; and this state would thus have the form
of the three good kinds of government, which are Monarchy,
Optimates, and People.<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c016'><sup>[442]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.32'></a>32.—“Next I should show him that of the cares which belong
to the prince, the most important is that of justice; for the maintenance
of which wise and well-tried men ought to be chosen to
office, whose foresight is true foresight accompanied by goodness,
for else it is not foresight, but cunning; and when this
goodness is lacking, the pleaders’ skill and subtlety always
work nothing but ruin and destruction to law and justice, and
the guilt of all their errours must be laid on him who put them
in office.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should tell how justice also fosters that piety towards God
which is the duty of all men, and especially of princes, who
ought to love Him above every other thing and direct all their
actions to Him as to the true end; and as Xenophon said, to
honour and love Him always, but much more when they are in
prosperity, so that afterwards they may the more reasonably
have confidence to ask Him for mercy when they are in some
adversity.<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c016'><sup>[443]</sup></a> For it is impossible to govern rightly either one’s
self or others without the help of God; who to the good sometimes
sends good fortune as His minister to relieve them from
grievous perils; sometimes adverse fortune, to prevent their
being so lulled by prosperity as to forget Him or human foresight,
which often repairs evil fortune, as a good player repairs
bad throws of the dice by placing his board well.<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c016'><sup>[444]</sup></a> Moreover I
should not cease reminding the prince to be truly religious—not
superstitious or given to the vanities of incantation and sooth-saying;
for by adding divine piety and true religion to human
foresight, he would have good fortune too and a protecting God
always to increase his prosperity in peace and in war.</p>

<p class='c001'>33.—“Next I should tell how he ought to love his land and
people, not holding them too much in bondage, lest he make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>himself odious to them, from which thing there arise seditions,
conspiracies and a thousand other evils; nor yet in too great
freedom, lest he be despised, from which proceed licentious and
dissolute life among his people, rapine, theft, murder, without
any fear of the law; often the ruin and total destruction of city
and realms. Next, how he ought to love those near him according
to their degree, maintaining among all men an even equality
in some things, as in justice and liberty; and in certain other
things a judicious inequality, as in being generous, in rewarding,
in distributing honours and dignities according to the inequality
of their merits, which always ought not to exceed but to be
exceeded by their rewards; and that in this way he would be not
merely loved but almost adored by his subjects. Nor would
there be need that he should turn to aliens for the safeguard
of his life, because his own people for their very profit would
guard it with their own, and all men would gladly obey the
laws, when they found that he himself obeyed and was as it
were the guardian and incorruptible minister of the same; and
thus he would make so strong an impression in this matter, that
even if he sometimes chanced to infringe the laws in some particular,
everyone would feel that it was done for a good end, and
the same respect and reverence would be paid to his wish as to
the law itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thus the minds of his subjects would be so tempered that
the good would not seek for more than they needed, and the bad
could not; for excessive riches are oftentimes the cause of great
ruin, as in poor Italy, which has been and still is exposed as
a prey to foreign nations, both because of bad government and
because of the great riches of which it is full. Hence it were
well to have the greater part of the citizens neither very
rich nor very poor, for the over-rich often become insolent and
rash; the poor, base and dishonest; but men of moderate fortune
do not lay snares for others, and live safe from being snared:
and being the greater number, these men of moderate fortune
are also more powerful; and therefore neither the poor nor
the rich can conspire against the prince or other men, nor can
they sow seditions; wherefore, in order to avoid this evil, it is
a very wholesome thing to preserve a mean in all things.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>34.—“I should say then, that the prince ought to employ these and
many other suitable precautions, so that there may not arise in
his subjects’ mind a desire for new things and for a change of government;
which they most often bring to pass either for gain or
else for honour which they hope for, or because of loss or else of
shame which they fear. And this unrest is engendered in their
minds sometimes by hatred and anger driving them to despair,
by reason of the wrongs and insults that have been wrought upon
them through the avarice, insolence and cruelty or lust of their
superiors; sometimes by the contempt that is aroused in them
by the neglect and baseness and unworthiness of their princes.
These two errours ought to be avoided by winning the people’s
love and obedience; as is done by benefiting and rewarding the
good, and by prudently and sometimes severely precluding the
bad and seditious from becoming powerful, which is much easier
to prevent before they have become so than to deprive them of
power after they have once acquired it. And I should say that
to prevent a subject from running into these errours, there is no
better way than to keep him from evil practices, and especially
from those that spread little by little; for they are secret pests
that infect cities before it is possible to cure or even to detect
them.</p>

<p class='c001'>“By such means I should advise that the prince contrive to
keep his subjects in a tranquil state, and to give them the blessings
of mind and body and fortune; but those of the body and of
fortune, in order to be able to exercise those of the mind, which
are the more profitable the greater and more superabundant
they are; which is not true of those of the body and of fortune.
If, then, the subjects be good and worthy and rightly directed
towards the goal of happiness, their prince is a very great lord;
for that is a true and great dominion, under which the subjects
are good and well governed and well commanded.”</p>

<p class='c001'>35.—Then my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think that he would be a small lord under whom all the
subjects were good, for in every place the good are few.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Ottaviano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“If some Circe were to change all the subjects of the King of
France into wild beasts, would he not seem to you a small lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>for all he ruled over so many thousand animals?<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c016'><sup>[445]</sup></a> And on the
other hand, if only the flocks that roam our mountains here for
pasture were to become wise men and worthy cavaliers, would
you not think that those herdsmen who governed them and were
obeyed by them, had become great lords instead of herdsmen?
You see then, that it is not the number but the worth of their
subjects that makes princes great.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.36'></a>36.—My lady Duchess and my lady Emilia and all the others had
been for a good space very attentive to my lord Ottaviano’s discourse;
but since he now made a little pause, as if he had finished
his discourse, messer Cesare Gonzaga said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Verily, my lord Ottaviano, it cannot be said that your precepts
are not good and useful; nevertheless I should think that
if you fashioned your prince after them, you would rather deserve
the name of a good school-master than of a good Courtier, and
he rather that of a good governor than of a great prince. I am
far from saying that the care of lords should not be to have their
people well ruled with justice and good uses; nevertheless methinks
it is enough for them to select good ministers to dispose
of such matters, and that their true office is much greater.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore if I felt myself to be that excellent Courtier which
these gentlemen have described, and to possess the favour of my
prince, I certainly should not lead him into anything vicious;
but, to pursue that good end which you tell of, and which I agree
ought to be the fruit of the Courtier’s toils and actions, I should
seek to impress upon his mind a certain greatness, together with
that regal splendour and readiness of mind and unconquered
valour in war which should make him loved and revered by
everyone to such a degree that he should be famous and illustrious
in the world chiefly for this. I should tell him also that he
ought to accompany his greatness with a familiar gentleness,
with that sweet and amiable humanity, and a fine manner of
caressing both his subjects and strangers with discrimination,
more or less according to their merits,—always preserving, however,
the majesty suited to his rank, so as not to allow his authority
to abate one jot from over-condescension, nor on the other hand
to excite hatred by too stern severity; that he ought to be very
generous and splendid, and to give to all men without reserve,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>because God, as the saying runs, is the treasurer of generous
princes; that he ought to give magnificent banquets, festivals,
games, public shows; to have a great number of excellent horses
(for use in war and for pleasure in time of peace), falcons, hounds,
and all things else that pertain to the pleasures of great lords
and of the people: as in our days we have seen done by my lord
Francesco Gonzaga, Marquess of Mantua, who in these matters
seems rather King of Italy than lord of a city.<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c016'><sup>[446]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“I should seek also to induce him to erect great buildings, both
to win honour in his lifetime and to give a memorial of himself
to posterity: as Duke Federico did in the case of this noble palace,<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c016'><sup>[447]</sup></a>
and as Pope Julius is now doing in the case of St. Peter’s
Church<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c016'><sup>[448]</sup></a> and of that street which leads from the Palace to his
pleasure pavilion the Belvedere,<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c016'><sup>[449]</sup></a> and many other buildings: as
also the ancient Romans did, whereof we see so many remains
at Rome and at Naples, at Pozzuoli, at Baja, at Civita Vecchia,
at Porto,<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c016'><sup>[450]</sup></a> and out of Italy too, and many other places,—which
are great proof of the worth of those divine minds.<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c016'><sup>[451]</sup></a> So did
Alexander the Great also, for not content with the fame that he
had justly won by having conquered the world with arms, he
built Alexandria in Egypt, Bucephalia in India,<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c016'><sup>[452]</sup></a> and other cities
in other countries; and he thought of reducing Mount Athos to
the form of a man, and of building a very spacious city in its left
hand, and in its right a great basin in which were to be gathered
all the rivers that take their rise there, and from it they were to
flow over into the sea:<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c016'><sup>[453]</sup></a> a truly great thought and one worthy
of Alexander the Great.</p>

<p class='c001'>“These, my lord Ottaviano, are things which I think befit a
noble and true prince, and make him very glorious in peace and
war; and not setting his mind to so many trifles, and taking care
to fight solely in order to rule or conquer those who deserve to
be ruled, or for his subjects’ profit, or to deprive those of power
who wield it ill. For if the Romans, Alexander, Hannibal and
the others had had these aims, they would not have reached that
height of glory to which they did attain.”</p>

having taught so many good customs to those barbarous tribes
which he overcame, that out of wild beasts he made them men?
He built so many fine cities in lands that were ill-inhabited, and
introduced right living there, and as it were united Asia and
Europe by the bond of friendship and holy laws, that those who
were conquered by him were happier than the others. For to
some he taught marriage, to others agriculture, to others religion,
others he taught not to kill but to support their fathers when
grown old, others to abstain from union with their mothers, and
a thousand other things that could be told in proof of the benefit
which his victories conferred upon the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>38.—“But leaving the ancients aside, what more noble and glorious
enterprise and more profitable could there be than for
Christians to devote their power to subjugating the infidels?<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c016'><sup>[456]</sup></a>
Do you not think that this war, if it succeeded prosperously and
were the means of turning so many thousand men from the false
sect of Mahomet to the light of Christian truth, would be as
profitable to the vanquished as to the victors? And truly, as
Themistocles once said to his family, being banished from his
native land and received by the King of Persia and caressed and
honoured with countless and very rich gifts: ‘My friends, we
should have been undone but for our undoing;’<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c016'><sup>[457]</sup></a> so with reason
might the Turks and Moors then say the same, because in their
loss would lie their salvation.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore I hope that we shall yet see this happiness, if God
grant life enough for Monseigneur d’Angoulême to attain the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>crown of France,<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c016'><sup>[458]</sup></a> who gives such promise of himself as my lord
Magnifico told of four evenings since; and for my lord Henry,
Prince of Wales,<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c016'><sup>[459]</sup></a> to attain that of England, who now is growing
up under his great father in every sort of virtue,<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c016'><sup>[460]</sup></a> like a tender
shoot under the shade of an excellent and fruit-laden tree, to
renew it with much greater beauty and fruitfulness when the time
shall be; for as our friend Castiglione writes thence,<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c016'><sup>[461]</sup></a> and promises
to tell more fully on his return, it seems that nature wished
in this lord to show her power by gathering in a single body
enough excellences to adorn a host.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Bernardo Bibbiena said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Very great promise is shown also by Don Carlos, Prince of
Spain, who (although not yet arrived at the tenth year of his age)
already shows so much capacity and such certain signs of goodness,
of foresight, of modesty, of magnanimity and of every
virtue, that if the empire of Christendom shall be (as men think)
in his hands, we may believe that he must eclipse the name of
many ancient emperors, and equal the fame of the most famous
that have been on earth.”<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c016'><sup>[462]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>39.—My lord Ottaviano added:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I think, then, that such divine princes as these have been
sent by God on earth, and by Him made to resemble one another
in youth, in martial power, in state, in beauty and bodily shape,
to the end that they may be of one accord for this good purpose
also. And if there must ever be any envy or emulation among
them, it may be solely in wishing to be each the first and most
fervent and zealous for so glorious an enterprise.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But let us leave this discourse and return to our subject. I
say, then, messer Cesare, that the things which you wish the
prince to do are very great and worthy of much praise; but you
ought to understand that if he does not know that which I have
said he ought to know, and has not formed his mind after that
pattern and directed it to the path of virtue, he will hardly know
how to be magnanimous, generous, just, courageous, foreseeing,
or to possess any of those other qualities that are looked for
in him. Nor yet would I have him such merely for the sake of
being able to exercise these qualities: for just as those who
build are not all good architects, so those who give are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>all generous; because virtue never harms any man, and there
are many who rob in order to give away, and thus are generous
with the property of others; some give to those they ought not,
and leave in misfortune and distress those to whom they are
beholden; others give with a certain bad grace and almost spite,
so that men see they do so on compulsion; others not only make
no secret of it, but call witnesses and almost proclaim their
generosities; others foolishly empty the fountain of their generosity
at a draught, so that it can be no more used again.</p>

<p>PRINCE HENRY OF WALES<br />AFTERWARDS HENRY VIII OF ENGLAND<br />1491-1547</p>

<p class='c004'>Reduced from Walker and Boutall’s photograph of an anonymous portrait (no. 157) in

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.40'></a>40.—“Hence in this, as in other things, it is needful to know
and to govern one’s self with that foresight which is the necessary
companion of all the virtues; which being midway are near
the two extremes—that is, the vices; and thus he who does not
know, easily runs into them. For just as it is difficult to find the
central point in a circle, which is the mean, so is it difficult to
find the point of virtue set midway between the two extremes
(vicious, the one because of excess, the other because of deficiency);
and to these we are inclined, sometimes to one and
sometimes to the other. We perceive this in the pleasure or
displeasure that we feel within us, for by reason of the one
we do that which we ought not, and by reason of the other we
fail to do that which we ought; but the pleasure is much the
more dangerous, because our judgment allows itself to be easily
corrupted by it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But since it is a difficult thing to perceive how far a man
is from the central point of virtue, we ought of our own accord
to withdraw step by step in the direction opposite to the extreme
towards which we perceive ourselves to be inclined, as those do
who straighten crooked timbers; for in such wise we approximate
to virtue, which (as I have said) consists in that central
point. Hence it happens that we err in many ways and perform
our office and duty in only one way, just like archers, who
hit the mark by one way only and miss the target by many.
Thus, in his wish to be humane and affable, one prince often
does countless things beneath his dignity, and so abases himself
that he is despised; another, to preserve his grave majesty with
becoming authority, becomes austere and intolerable; another,
to be held eloquent, strays into a thousand strange fashions and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>long mazes of affected words, listening to himself to such a
degree that others cannot listen to him for weariness.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.41'></a>41.—“Therefore do not call anything a trifle, messer Cesare,
that can improve a prince in any particular, however slight
it be; nor must you suppose that I think you disparage my precepts
when you say that by them a good governor would be
fashioned rather than a good prince; for perhaps no greater or
more fitting praise can be given to a prince than to call him
a good governor. Hence if it lay with me to instruct him, I
would have him take care to heed not only the matters already
mentioned, but those which are much smaller, and as far as possible
understand all details affecting his people, nor ever so
believe or trust any one of his ministers as to confide to that one
alone the bridle and control of all his government. For there is
no man who is very apt for all things, and much greater harm
arises from the credulity of lords than from their incredulity,
which not only sometimes does no harm, but often is of the
greatest advantage: albeit in this matter there is need of good
judgment in the prince, to perceive who deserves to be believed
and who does not.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I would have him take care to understand the acts and be
the overseer of his ministers; to settle and shorten disputes
among his subjects; to be the means of making peace among
them, and of allying them in marriage; to have his city all united
and agreed in friendship like a private family, populous, not poor,
peaceful, full of good artificers; to favour merchants and even to
aid them with money; to be generous and splendid in hospitality
towards foreigners and ecclesiastics; to moderate all superfluities,
for through the errours that are committed in these matters,
small though they seem, cities often come to ruin. Wherefore it
is reasonable that the prince should set a limit upon the too
sumptuous houses of private folk, upon feasts, upon the excessive
doweries of women, upon their luxury, upon their display in
jewels and vesture, which is naught but a proof of their folly;
for besides often wasting their husbands’ goods and substance
through the ambition and the envy which they bear one another,
they sometimes sell their honour to anyone who will buy it, for
the sake of a trinket or some other like trifle.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span><a id='sec4.42'></a>42.—Then messer Bernardo Bibbiena said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My lord Ottaviano, you are taking sides with my lord Gaspar
and Frisio.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Ottaviano replied, also laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“The dispute is finished, and I am far from wishing to renew
it; so I shall say no more of women, but return to my prince.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Frisio replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You can very well leave him now, and rest content that he
should be such as you have described him. For without doubt
it would be easier to find a lady with the qualities mentioned by
my lord Magnifico, than a prince with the qualities mentioned
by you; hence I fear that he is like Plato’s Republic, and that we
are never to see his equal, unless perhaps in Heaven.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Ottaviano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Although they be difficult, things that are possible may still
be hoped to come to pass. Therefore we shall in our times perhaps
yet see him on earth; for although the heavens are so chary
of producing excellent princes that hardly one is seen in many
centuries, this good fortune may fall to us.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Count Ludovico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I certainly trust that it may be so; for, besides those three
great princes whom we have named, to whom we may look for
that which has been said to befit the highest type of a perfect
prince,—there are also to be found in Italy to-day several princes’
sons, who, although they are not likely to have such great power,
will perhaps fill its place with worth. And the one among them
all who shows the best natural bent, and gives greater promise
than any of the others, seems to me to be my lord Federico Gonzaga,
eldest son of the Marquess of Mantua and nephew to our
lady Duchess here.<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c016'><sup>[463]</sup></a> For besides the gentleness of behaviour
and the discretion which he shows at such a tender age, those
who have charge of him tell wonderful things of his capacity,
eagerness for honour, magnanimity, courtesy, generosity, love
of justice; so that from so good a beginning we cannot but hope
for the best of ends.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Frisio said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“No more of this at present; we will pray God that we may
see this hope of yours fulfilled.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span><a id='sec4.43'></a>43.—Here my lord Ottaviano, turning to my lady Duchess with
an air of having finished his discourse, said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“There, my Lady, is what occurs to me to say about the aim
of the Courtier; wherein, if I shall not have wholly given satisfaction,
it will at least be enough for me to have shown that
some further perfection could be given him in addition to the
things mentioned by these gentlemen; who, methinks, omitted
both this and all that I might say, not because they did not know
it better than I, but in order to save themselves trouble; therefore
I will leave them to continue, if they have anything left to
say.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lady Duchess said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not only is the hour so late that it will soon be time to stop
for the evening, but it seems to me that we ought not to mingle
any other discourse with this; wherein you have gathered so
many different and beautiful things, that we may say (touching
the aim of Courtiership) not only that you are the perfect Courtier
whom we seek, and competent to instruct your prince rightly,
but if fortune shall be favourable to you, that you ought also to
be an admirable prince, which would be of great advantage to
your country.”<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c016'><sup>[464]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Ottaviano laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“If I held such rank, my Lady, perhaps it would be with me as
it is wont to be with many others, who know better how to speak
than to act.”</p>

<p class='c001'>44.—Here the matter having been debated back and forth awhile
among the whole company, with some little contradiction albeit
in praise of what had been said, and it being suggested that it
was not yet time to go to rest, the Magnifico Giuliano said,
laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lady, I am so great an enemy to guile, that I am forced
to contradict my lord Ottaviano, who, from having (as I fear)
conspired secretly with my lord Gaspar against women, has fallen
into two errours to my thinking very grave: one of which is, that in
order to set this Courtier above the Court Lady and make him
transcend the bounds that she can reach, my lord Ottaviano has
set the Courtier also above the prince, which is most unseemly;
the other is in setting him such a goal that it is always difficult,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>and sometimes impossible for him to reach it, and that even when
he does reach it, he ought not to be called a Courtier.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I do not understand,” said my lady Emilia, “how it should be
so difficult or impossible for the Courtier to reach this goal of his,
nor yet how my lord Ottaviano has set him above the prince.”<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c016'><sup>[465]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not grant him these things,” replied my lord Ottaviano,
“for I have not set the Courtier above the prince, nor do I think
I have fallen into any errour touching the aim of Courtiership.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the Magnifico Giuliano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You cannot say, my lord Ottaviano, that the cause which
gives a certain quality to a result, does not always have more of
that quality than its result has. Thus the Courtier, through
whose instruction the prince is to become so excellent, must
needs be more excellent than his prince; and in this way he will
also be of greater dignity than the prince himself, which is most
unseemly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then, as for the aim of Courtiership, what you said may be
true when the prince’s age is little different from the Courtier’s,
but still not without difficulty, for where there is small difference
in age, it is natural that there should be small difference in knowledge
also; while if the prince is old and the Courtier young, it is
fitting that the old prince should know more than the young
Courtier; and if this does not always happen, it happens sometimes,
and then the goal which you set the Courtier is impossible.
Again, if the prince is young and the Courtier old, the Courtier
can hardly win the prince’s mind by means of those accomplishments
that you have ascribed to him. For to say the truth,
jousting and other exercises of the person belong to young men
and do not befit old men, and music and dancing and festivals
and games and love-making are ridiculous in old age; and methinks
they would be very ill-befitting a director of the prince’s
life and behaviour, who ought to be a very sober person of
authority, mature in years and experience, and (if possible) a
good philosopher, a good commander, and ought to know almost
everything.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore I think that whoever instructs the prince ought
not to be called a Courtier, but deserves a far higher and more
honoured name. So pardon me, my lord Ottaviano, if I have exposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>your fallacy; for methinks I am bound to do so for the
honour of my Lady, whom you, forsooth, would have of less dignity
than this Courtier of yours, and I will not allow it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>45.—My lord Ottaviano laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My lord Magnifico, it would be more praise to the Court Lady
to exalt her until she equalled the Courtier, than to abase the
Courtier until he equalled the Court Lady; for it would be by no
means forbidden the Lady to teach the mistress also, and with her
to tend towards that aim of Courtiership which I said befits the
Courtier with the prince. But you seek more to censure the
Courtier than to praise the Court Lady; hence I too shall be
allowed to take the Courtier’s part.</p>

<p class='c001'>“To reply, then, to your objections, I declare I did not say that
the Courtier’s instruction ought to be the sole cause of making
the prince such as we would have him. For if he were not by
nature inclined and fitted to be so, all the Courtier’s care and reminders
would be in vain: just as any good husbandman also
would labour in vain if he were to set about cultivating barren
sea-sand and sowing it with excellent seed, because such barrenness
is natural in that place; but when to good seed in fertile
soil, and to mildness of climate and rains suited to the season,
there is added also the diligence of human culture, very abundant
crops are always found to spring up plenteously. Nor is it on
that account true that the husbandman alone is the cause of this,
although without him all the other things would avail little or
nothing. Thus there are many princes who would be good if
their minds were rightly cultivated; and it is of these that I am
speaking, not of those who are like barren ground, and by nature
so alien to good behaviour that no training avails to lead their
minds in the straight path.</p>

<p class='c001'>46.—“And since, as we have already said, our habits are what
our actions make them, and virtue consists in action, it is not
impossible or marvellous that the Courtier should turn the prince
to many virtues, like justice, generosity, magnanimity, the practice
whereof the prince by his greatness can easily put in use and
convert into habit; which the Courtier cannot do, because he
has not the means to practise them; and thus the prince, allured
to virtue by the Courtier, may become more virtuous than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>Courtier. Moreover you must know that the whetstone, although
it cuts nothing, yet makes iron sharp. Hence it seems to me
that although the Courtier instructs the prince, he need not on
that account be said to be of more dignity than the prince.</p>

<p class='c001'>“That the aim of this Courtiership is difficult and sometimes
impossible, and that even when the Courtier attains it, he ought
not to be called a Courtier, but deserves a greater name,—I say
that I do not deny this difficulty, since it is not less difficult to
find so excellent a Courtier than to attain such an end. Yet methinks
there is no impossibility, even in the case that you cited:
for if the Courtier is too young to know that which we have said
he ought to know, we need not speak of him, since he is not the
Courtier we are presupposing, nor is it possible that one who
has to know so many things should be very young.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And if, indeed, the prince shall chance to be so wise and good
by nature that he has no need of precepts and counsel from
others (although everyone knows how difficult this is), it will be
enough for the Courtier to be such a man as could make the
prince virtuous if he had need of it. And then the Courtier will
be at least able to perform the other part of his duty,—not to
allow his prince to be deceived, always to make known the truth
about everything, and to set himself against flatterers and slanderers
and all those who plot to debase his prince’s mind with
unworthy pleasures. And in this way he will also attain his
end in great part, although he cannot put everything in practice:
which will not be a reason for finding fault with him, since he
refrains therefrom for so good a cause. For if an excellent physician
were to find himself in a place where everyone was in
health, it would not for that reason be right to say that this physician
failed in his aim, although he healed no sick. Thus, just
as the physician’s aim ought to be men’s health, so the Courtier’s
ought to be his prince’s virtue; and it is enough for them both to
have their aim latent within their power, if their failure to attain
it openly in acts arises from the subject to which the aim is
directed.</p>

<p class='c001'>“But if the Courtier were so old that it would not become him
to practise music, festivals, games, arms, and the other personal
accomplishments, still we cannot say that it is impossible for him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>to win his prince’s favour by that road. For if his age prevents
his practising those things, it does not prevent his understanding
them, and if he has practised them in his youth, it does not prevent
his having the more perfect judgment regarding them, and
his knowing the more perfectly how to teach them to his prince,
in proportion as years and experience bring more knowledge of
everything. Thus, although the old Courtier does not practise
the accomplishments ascribed to him, he will yet attain his aim
of instructing his prince rightly.</p>

<p class='c001'>47.—“And if you are unwilling to call him Courtier, it does not
trouble me; for nature has not set such limit upon human dignities
that a man may not mount from one to another. Thus, common
soldiers often become captains; private persons, kings; and
priests, popes; and pupils, masters; and thus, together with the
dignity, they acquire the name also. Hence perhaps we might
say that to become his prince’s instructor was the Courtier’s aim.
However, I do not know who would refuse this name of perfect
Courtier, which in my opinion is worthy of very great praise.
And it seems to me that just as Homer described two most excellent
men as patterns of human life,—the one in deeds (which
was Achilles), the other in sufferings and endurance (which was
Ulysses),—so also he described a perfect Courtier (which was
Phœnix), who, after narrating his loves and many other youthful
affairs, says that he was sent to Achilles by the latter’s father,
Peleus, as a companion and to teach the youth how to speak and
act: which is naught else but the aim which we have marked
out for our Courtier.<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c016'><sup>[466]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Nor do I think that Aristotle and Plato would have scorned
the name of perfect Courtier, for we clearly see that they performed
the works of Courtiership and wrought to this end,—the
one with Alexander the Great, the other with the kings of Sicily.
And since the office of a good Courtier is to know the prince’s
character and inclinations, and thus to enter tactfully into his
favour according to need and opportunity, as we have said, by
those ways that afford safe access, and then to lead him towards
virtue,—Aristotle so well knew the character of Alexander, and
tactfully fostered it so well, that he was loved and honoured
more than a father by Alexander.<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c016'><sup>[467]</sup></a> Thus, among many other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>tokens that Alexander gave him of good will, the king ordered
the rebuilding of his native city, Stagira, which had been destroyed;<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c016'><sup>[468]</sup></a>
and besides directing Alexander to that most glorious
aim,—which was the desire to make the world as one single
universal country, and all men as a single people to live in amity
and mutual concord under a single government and a single law,
which should shine equally on all like the light of the sun,<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c016'><sup>[469]</sup></a>—Aristotle
so instructed him in the natural sciences and in the
virtues of the mind as to make him most wise, brave, continent,
and a true moral philosopher, not only in words but in deeds;
for a nobler philosophy cannot be imagined than to bring into
civilized living such savage people as those who inhabited Bactria
and Caucasia, India, Scythia;<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c016'><sup>[470]</sup></a> and to teach them marriage,
agriculture, honour to their fathers, abstention from rapine,
murder and other evil ways; to build so many very noble cities
in distant lands;—so that countless men were by his laws reduced
from savage life to civilization. And of these achievements of
Alexander the author was Aristotle, using the means of a good
Courtier: which Callisthenes knew not how to do, although
Aristotle showed him;<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c016'><sup>[471]</sup></a> for in his wish to be a pure philosopher
and austere minister of naked truth, without mingling Courtiership
therewith, he lost his life and brought not help but rather
infamy to Alexander.</p>

<p class='c001'>“By these same means of Courtiership, Plato schooled Dio
of Syracuse;<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c016'><sup>[472]</sup></a> and having afterwards found the tyrant Dionysius
like a book all full of faults and errours and in need of complete
erasure rather than of any change or correction (since it was not
possible to remove from him that tinge of tyranny wherewith he
had so long been stained), Plato was unwilling to practise the
ways of Courtiership upon him, thinking that they all would
surely be in vain. Which our Courtier also ought to do, if by
chance he finds himself in the service of a prince of so evil a disposition
as to be inveterate in vice, like consumptives in their malady;
for in such case he ought to escape that bondage, in order
not to receive blame for his lord’s evil deeds, and in order not to
feel that distress which all good men feel who serve the wicked.”</p>

<p class='c001'>48.—Here my lord Ottaviano having ceased speaking, my lord
Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>“I did not in the least suspect that our Courtier was so honoured;
but since Aristotle and Plato are his fellows, I think that
no one ought henceforth to scorn this name. Still I am far from
sure whether I believe that Aristotle and Plato ever danced
or made music in their lives, or performed any other acts of
chivalry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Ottaviano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“It is hardly permitted to think that these two divine spirits
did not know everything, and hence we may believe that they
practised what pertains to Courtiership, for on occasion they
write of it in such fashion that the very masters of the subjects
written of by them perceive that they understood the same to
the marrow and deepest roots. Wherefore there is no ground
for saying that all the accomplishments ascribed to him by these
gentlemen do not befit a Courtier (or instructor of the prince,
as you like to call him) who contributes to that good end which
we have mentioned, even though he were a very stern philosopher
and most saintly in his behaviour, because they are
not at variance with goodness, discretion, wisdom, worth, at
every age and in every time and place.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.49'></a>49.—Then my lord Gaspar said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I remember that in discussing the accomplishments of the
Courtier last evening, these gentlemen desired that he should be
in love; and since, by reviewing what has thus far been said, we
might conclude that a Courtier who has to allure his prince to
virtue by his worth and authority, must almost of necessity be
old (because knowledge very rarely comes before years, and
especially in those things that are learned by experience),—I do
not know how becoming it is for him (being advanced in age) to
be in love. For as has been said this evening, love does not sit
well upon old men, and those things which in young men are
delights, courtesies and elegances very pleasing to women, in
old men are extravagances and ridiculous incongruities, and for
him who practises them win hatred from women and derision
from others.</p>

<p class='c001'>“So if your friend Aristotle, the old Courtier, were in love, and
did those things which young lovers do, like some whom we
have seen in our days,—I fear he would forget to instruct his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>prince, and perhaps children would mock at him behind his
back, and women would get little pleasure from him except to
deride him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lord Ottaviano said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“As all the other accomplishments ascribed to the Courtier
befit him although he be old, methinks we ought by no means to
deprive him of this enjoyment of loving.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nay,” said my lord Gaspar, “to deprive him of love is to give
him an added perfection, and to make him live at ease remote
from misery and calamity.”</p>

<p class='c001'>50.—Messer Pietro Bembo said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you not remember, my lord Gaspar, that although he is
little skilled in love, yet in his game the other evening my lord
Ottaviano seemed to know that there are some lovers who call
sweet the scorns and ires and warrings and torments which they
have from their ladies; whence he asked to be taught the cause
of this sweetness? Therefore if our Courtier, although old, were
inflamed with those loves that are sweet without bitterness, he
would feel no calamity or misery in them; and if he were wise, as
we suppose him to be, he would not deceive himself by thinking
that all was befitting to him which befits young men; but if he
loved, perhaps he would love in a way that would bring him not
only no blame, but much praise and highest happiness unaccompanied
by any pain, which rarely and almost never happens with
young men; and thus he would not fail to instruct his prince, nor
would he do aught to deserve the mockery of children.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lady Duchess said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am glad, messer Pietro, that you have had little fatigue in
our discussion this evening, for now we shall with more assurance
impose on you the burden of speaking, and of teaching the Courtier
this love which is so happy that it brings with it neither blame
nor discomfort; for perhaps it will be one of the most important
and useful attributes that have thus far been ascribed to him:
therefore tell us, on your faith, all you know about it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Pietro laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I should be sorry, my Lady, that my saying it is permissible
for old men to love should be a reason for these ladies to regard
me as old; therefore please to give this task to someone else.”<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c016'><sup>[473]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>My lady Duchess replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You ought not to shun being reputed old in wisdom, even if
you are young in years; so speak on, and make no more excuse.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Pietro said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed, my Lady, if I must talk about this matter, I should
need to go take counsel with my Lavinello’s Hermit.”<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c016'><sup>[474]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lady Emilia said, half vexed:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Messer Pietro, there is no one in the company who is more
disobedient than you; therefore it will be well for my lady Duchess
to inflict some chastisement upon you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Pietro said, again smiling:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Be not angry with me, my Lady, for love of God; for I will
tell what you wish.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then tell it at once,” replied my lady Emilia.</p>

<p class='c001'>51.—Whereupon messer Pietro, having first remained silent
awhile, then settled himself a little as if about to speak of something
important, and spoke thus:<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c016'><sup>[475]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lords, in order to prove that old men can love not only
without blame but sometimes more happily than young men, it
will be needful for me to make a little discourse to explain what
love is, and in what consists the happiness that lovers may enjoy.
So I pray you hear me with attention, for I hope to make you see
that there is no man here whom it does not become to be in love,
even though he were fifteen or twenty years older than my lord
Morello.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And then after some laughter, messer Pietro continued:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I say, then, that according to the definition of the ancient sages
love is naught but a certain desire to enjoy beauty; and as desire
longs only for things that are perceived, perception must
needs always precede desire, which by its nature wishes good
things, but in itself is blind and does not perceive them. Therefore
nature has so ordained that to every faculty of perception
there is joined a certain faculty of appetite; and since in our soul
there are three modes of perceiving, that is, by sense, by reason,
and by intellect: from sense springs appetite, which we have in
common with the brutes; from reason springs choice, which is
peculiar to man; from the intellect, by which man is able to commune
with the angels, springs will. Thus, just as sense perceives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>only things that are perceptible by the senses, appetite desires
the same only; and just as intellect is directed solely to the contemplation
of things intellectual, the will feeds only upon spiritual
benefits. Being by nature rational and placed as a mean between
these two extremes, man is able at will (by descending to sense
or mounting to intellect) to turn his desires now in the one direction
and now in the other. In these two ways, therefore, it is
possible to desire beauty, which universal name applies to all
things (whether natural or artificial) that are framed in good
proportion and due measure according to their nature.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>52.—“But speaking of the beauty we have in mind, which is only
that which is seen in the bodies and especially in the faces of
men, and which excites this ardent desire that we call love,—we
will say that it is an effluence of divine goodness, and that although
it is diffused like the sun’s light upon all created things,
yet when it finds a face well proportioned and framed with a
certain pleasant harmony of various colours embellished by
lights and shadows and by an orderly distance and limit of outlines,
it infuses itself therein and appears most beautiful, and
adorns and illumines that object whereon it shines with grace and
wonderful splendour, like a sunbeam falling upon a beautiful vase
of polished gold set with precious gems. Thus it agreeably attracts
the eyes of men, and entering thereby, it impresses itself
upon the soul, and stirs and delights her with a new sweetness
throughout, and by kindling her it excites in her a desire for its
own self.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Then, being seized with desire to enjoy this beauty as something
good, if the soul allows herself to be guided by the
judgment of sense, she runs into very grievous errours, and
judges that the body wherein the beauty is seen is the chief
cause thereof; and hence, in order to enjoy that beauty, she
deems it necessary to join herself as closely to that body as she
can; which is false: and accordingly, whoever thinks to enjoy
the beauty by possessing the body deceives himself, and is
moved, not by true perception through reasonable choice, but by
false opinion through sensual appetite: wherefore the pleasure
also that results therefrom is necessarily false and vicious.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hence all those lovers who satisfy their unchaste desires
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>with the women whom they love, run into one of two errours:
for as soon as they have attained the end desired, they either not
only feel satiety and tedium, but hate the beloved object as
if appetite repented its errour and perceived the deceit practised
upon it by the false judgment of sense, which made it believe
evil to be good; or else they remain in the same desire and longing,
like those who have not truly attained the end they sought.
And although, by reason of the blind opinion wherewith they are
intoxicated, they think they feel pleasure at the moment, as the
sick sometimes dream of drinking at some clear spring, nevertheless
they are not contented or appeased. And since the possession
of a wished-for joy always brings quiet and satisfaction
to the mind of the possessor, if that joy were the true and worthy
object of their desire, they would remain quiet and satisfied
in possessing it; which they do not. Nay, deceived by that
likeness, they soon return to unbridled desire, and with the same
distress they felt at first, they find themselves furiously and very
ardently athirst for that which they vainly hope to possess perfectly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Such lovers as these, therefore, love most unhappily; for
either they never attain their desires (which is great unhappiness),
or if they do attain thereto, they find they have attained
their woe, and finish their miseries with other miseries still
greater; because even in the beginning and midst of their love
naught else is ever felt but anguish, torments, sorrows, sufferings,
toils. So that to be pale, melancholy, in continual tears
and sighs, to be sad, to be ever silent or lamenting, to long for
death, in short, to be most unhappy, are the conditions that
are said to befit lovers.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.53'></a>53.—“The cause, then, of this havoc in the minds of men is
chiefly sense, which is very potent in youth, because the vigour
of flesh and blood at that period gives to it as much strength as
it takes away from reason, and hence easily leads the soul
to follow appetite. For, finding herself plunged into an earthly
prison and deprived of spiritual contemplation by being set the
task of governing the body, the soul cannot of herself clearly
comprehend the truth; wherefore, in order to have perception
of things, she must needs go begging first notions from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>senses, and so she believes them and bows before them and
allows herself to be guided by them, especially when they have
so much vigour that they almost force her; and as they are
fallacious, they fill her with errours and false opinions.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hence it nearly always happens that young men are wrapped
in this love which is sensual and wholly rebellious to reason,
and thus they become unworthy to enjoy the graces and benefits
which love bestows upon its true subjects; nor do they feel any
pleasures in love beyond those which the unreasoning animals
feel, but anguish far more grievous.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This premise being admitted then,—and it is most true,—I
say that the contrary happens to those who are of maturer
age. For if such as these (when the soul is already less
weighed down by bodily heaviness and when the natural heat
begins to become tepid) are inflamed by beauty and turn thereto
a desire guided by rational choice,—they are not deceived, and
possess beauty perfectly. Therefore their possession of it always
brings them good; because beauty is good, and hence true
love of beauty is most good and holy, and always works for
good in the mind of those who restrain the perversity of sense
with the bridle of reason; which the old can do much more
easily than the young.</p>

<p class='c001'>54.—“Hence it is not beyond reason to say further that the old
can love without blame and more happily than the young;
taking this word old, however, not in the sense of decrepit, nor
when the bodily organs have already become so weak that the
soul cannot perform its functions through them, but when our
knowledge is at its true prime.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will not refrain from saying also this: which is, that I think
that although sensual love is evil at every age, yet in the young
it deserves excuse, and is perhaps in a measure permitted. For
although it gives them anguish, dangers, toils, and those woes
that have been told, still there are many who, to win the favour
of the ladies of their love, do worthy acts, which (although not
directed to a good end) are intrinsically good; and thus from
that mass of bitterness they extract a little sweet, and through
the adversities which they endure they at last perceive their
errour. Hence, just as I deem those youths divine who control
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>their appetites and love in reason, so I excuse those who allow
themselves to be overcome by sensual love, to which they are so
strongly inclined by human frailty: provided they show therein
gentleness, courtesy and worth, and the other noble qualities of
which these gentlemen have told; and provided that when they
are no longer of youthful age, they abandon it altogether, shunning
this sensual desire as it were the lowest round of the ladder
by which true love can be attained. But if, even after they are
old, they preserve the fire of appetite in their chill heart and subject
stout reason to frail sense, it is not possible to say how much
they are to be blamed. For like fools they deserve to be numbered
with perpetual infamy among the unreasoning animals,
since the thoughts and ways of sensual love are too unbecoming
to mature age.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.55'></a>55.—Here Bembo paused a little, as if to rest; and as everyone
remained silent, my lord Morello da Ortona said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“And if an old man were found more vigourous and sturdy
and of better looks than many youths, why would you not have
him allowed to love with that love wherewith young men love?”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lady Duchess laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“If young men’s love is so unhappy, my lord Morello, why do
you wish to have old men love thus unhappily also? But if you
were old, as these gentlemen say, you would not thus contrive
evil for old men.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Morello replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Methinks it is messer Pietro Bembo who is contriving evil
for old men, in that he wishes to have them love in a certain way
which I for my part do not understand; and methinks that to
possess this beauty which he so highly praises, without the body,
is a dream.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Count Ludovico said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do you believe, my lord Morello, that beauty is always as
good as messer Pietro Bembo says?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Not I indeed,” replied my lord Morello; “nay, I remember
having seen many beautiful women who were very bad, cruel
and spiteful; and this seems to be almost always so, for beauty
makes them proud, and pride makes them cruel.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Count Ludovico said, laughing:</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>“To you, perhaps, they seem cruel because they do not grant
you what you would have; but have yourself taught by messer
Pietro Bembo in what way old men ought to desire beauty, and
what they ought to seek from women, and with what they ought
to be content; and if you do not exceed these limits, you shall
see that they will not be either proud or cruel, and will grant
you what you wish.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lord Morello seemed a little vexed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I have no wish to know what does not concern me; but do
you have yourself taught how this beauty ought to be desired by
young men who are less vigourous and sturdy than their elders.”</p>

<p class='c001'>56.—Here messer Federico, to quiet my lord Morello and turn
the conversation, did not allow Count Ludovico to reply, but
interrupted him and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Perhaps my lord Morello is not altogether wrong in saying
that beauty is not always good; for women’s beauty is often the
cause that brings upon the world countless evils, hatreds, wars,
deaths and destructions; of which good proof can be found in
the fall of Troy. And beautiful women are for the most part
either proud or cruel, or (as has been said) immodest; but this
would not seem to my lord Morello a fault. There are also
many wicked men who have the gift of fair looks, and it seems
that nature made them thus to the end that they should be better
fitted to deceive, and that this gracious seeming is like the bait
upon the hook.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Pietro Bembo said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Do not believe that beauty is not always good.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here Count Ludovico, in order to return to the original subject,
interrupted and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Since my lord Morello does not care to know what so deeply
concerns him, teach it to me, and show me how old men attain
this happiness in love, for I shall not mind having myself thought
old, provided it help me.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.57'></a>57.—Messer Pietro laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish first to free these gentlemen’s minds from their errour;
then I will satisfy you too.” Resuming thus, he said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lords, I would not have any of us, like profane and sacrilegious
men, incur God’s wrath by speaking ill of beauty, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>is a sacred thing. Therefore, to the end that my lord Morello
and messer Federico may be warned, and not lose their sight, like
Stesichorus (which is a very fitting punishment for one who scorns
beauty),<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c016'><sup>[476]</sup></a> I say that beauty springs from God, and is like a circle
of which goodness is the centre. And hence, as there can be no
circle without a centre, there can be no beauty without goodness.
Thus a wicked soul rarely inhabits a beautiful body, and for that
reason outward beauty is a true sign of inward goodness. And
this grace is impressed upon bodies, more or less, as an index of
the soul, whereby she is known outwardly, as in the case of
trees, in which the beauty of the blossom gives token of the excellence
of the fruit. The same is true in the case of human
bodies, as we see that the Physiognomists often recognize in the
face the character and sometimes the thoughts of men; and what
is more, in beasts also we discern from the aspect the quality of
the mind, which is expressed as much as possible in the body.
Think how clearly we read anger, ferocity and pride in the face
of the lion, the horse, the eagle; a pure and simple innocence in
lambs and doves; cunning malice in foxes and wolves, and so of
nearly all other animals.</p>

<p class='c001'>58.—“The ugly are therefore for the most part wicked too, and
the beautiful are good: and we may say that beauty is the pleasant,
gay, acceptable and desirable face of good, and that ugliness
is the dark, disagreeable, unpleasant and sad face of evil.
And if you will consider all things, you will find that those which
are good and useful always have a charm of beauty also.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Look at the state of this great fabric of the world, which was
made by God for the health and preservation of every created
thing. The round firmament, adorned with so many heavenly
lights, and the earth in the centre, surrounded by the elements
and sustained by its own weight; the sun, which in its revolving
illumines the whole, and in winter approaches the lowest sign,
then little by little mounts to the other side; the moon, which
derives her light from it, according as it approaches her or
withdraws from her; and the five other stars, which separately
travel the same course.<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c016'><sup>[477]</sup></a> These things have such influence
upon one another through the linking of an order thus precisely
framed, that if they were changed for an instant, they could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>hold together, and would wreck the world; they have also such
beauty and grace that human wit cannot imagine anything more
beautiful.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Think now of the shape of man, which may be called a little
world; wherein we see every part of the body precisely composed
with skill, and not by chance; and then the whole form
together so beautiful that we could hardly decide whether more
utility or more grace is given to the human features and the rest
of the body by all the members, such as the eyes, nose, mouth,
ears, arms, breast, and other parts withal. The same can be said
of all the animals. Look at the feathers of birds, the leaves and
branches of trees, which are given them by nature to preserve
their being, and yet have also very great loveliness.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Leave nature, and come to art. What thing is so necessary
in ships as the prow, the sides, the yards, the masts, the sails, the
helm, the oars, the anchors and the cordage? Yet all these things
have so much comeliness, that it seems to him who looks upon
them that they are thus devised as much for beauty as for use.
Columns and architraves support lofty galleries and palaces, yet
they are not on that account less pleasing to the eyes of him who
looks upon them, than useful to the buildings. When men first
began to build, they set that middle ridge in their temples and
houses, not in order that the buildings might have more grace,
but to the end that the water might flow off conveniently on
either side; yet to utility soon was added comeliness, so that if a
temple were built under a sky where no hail or rain falls, it would
not seem able to have any dignity or beauty without the ridge.</p>

<p class='c001'>59.—“Much praise is therefore bestowed, not only upon other
things, but upon the world, by saying that it is beautiful. We
praise when we say: ‘Beautiful sky, beautiful earth, beautiful
sea, beautiful rivers, beautiful lands, beautiful woods, trees, gardens;
beautiful cities, beautiful churches, houses, armies.’ In
short, this gracious and sacred beauty gives highest ornament to
everything; and we may say that the good and the beautiful are
in a way one and the same thing, and especially in the human
body; of whose beauty I think the most immediate cause is beauty
of the soul, which (as partaker of true divine beauty) brightens
and beautifies whatever it touches, and especially if the body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>wherein it dwells is not of such base material that it cannot impress
thereon its quality. Therefore beauty is the true trophy of
the soul’s victory, when with power divine she holds sway over
material nature, and by her light overcomes the darkness of the
body.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hence we must not say that beauty makes women proud
or cruel, although it may seem so to my lord Morello; nor
yet ought we to ascribe to beautiful women those enmities,
deaths and destructions of which the immoderate appetites of
men are the cause. I do not by any means deny that it is possible
to find beautiful women in the world who are also immodest,
but it is not at all because their beauty inclines them to
immodesty; nay, it turns them therefrom and leads them to the
path of virtuous behaviour, by the connection that beauty has
with goodness. But sometimes evil training, the continual
urgence of their lovers, gifts, poverty, hope, deceits, fear and a
thousand other causes, overcome the steadfastness even of
beautiful and good women; and through these or similar causes
beautiful men also may become wicked.”</p>

<p class='c001'>60.—Then messer Cesare said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“If that is true which my lord Gaspar alleged yesterday, there
is no doubt that beautiful women are more chaste than ugly
women.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And what did I allege?” said my lord Gaspar.</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Cesare replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“If I remember rightly, you said that women who are wooed
always refuse to satisfy him who wooes them, and that those who
are not wooed woo others. Certain it is that the beautiful are
always more wooed and besought in love than are the ugly;
therefore the beautiful always refuse, and hence are more chaste
than the ugly, who, not being wooed, woo others.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bembo laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“To this argument no answer can be made.” Then he added:
“It often happens also that our sight deceives us like our other
senses, and accounts a face beautiful which in truth is not
beautiful; and since in some women’s eyes and whole aspect a
certain wantonness is seen depicted, together with unseemly
blandishments,—many (who like such manner because it promises
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>them ease in attaining what they desire) call it beauty: but
in truth it is disguised immodesty, unworthy a name so honoured
and so sacred.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Pietro Bembo was silent, and those gentlemen still
urged him to speak further of this love and of the mode of enjoying
beauty truly; and he at last said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Methinks I have shown clearly enough that old men can love
more happily than young, which was my thesis; therefore it
does not become me to go further.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Count Ludovico replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have better shown the unhappiness of youths than the
happiness of old men, whom as yet you have not taught what
road to follow in this love of theirs, but have only told them to
be guided by reason; and by many it is thought impossible for
love to abide with reason.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.61'></a>61.—Bembo still sought to put an end to his discourse, but my
lady Duchess begged him to speak; and he began anew thus:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Too unhappy would human nature be, if our soul (wherein
such ardent desire can spring up easily) were forced to feed it
solely upon that which is common to her with the beasts, and
could not direct it to that other nobler part which is peculiar to
herself. Therefore, since so indeed it pleases you, I have no
wish to avoid discoursing upon this noble subject. And as I feel
myself unworthy to speak of Love’s most sacred mysteries, I pray
him so to inspire my thought and tongue that I may be able to
show this excellent Courtier how to love beyond the manner of
the vulgar crowd; and since from boyhood up I have dedicated
my whole life to him, so now also may my words comport with
this intent and with his praise.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I say, then, that as in youth human nature is so greatly prone
to sense, the Courtier may be allowed to love sensually while he
is young. But if afterwards in maturer years he chances still to
be kindled with this amourous desire, he must be very wary and
take care not to deceive himself by allowing himself to be led
into those calamities which in the young merit more compassion
than blame, and, on the contrary, in the old more blame than
compassion.</p>

<p class='c001'>62.—“Therefore when the gracious aspect of some fair woman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>meets his view, accompanied with such sweet behaviour and
gentle manners that he, as an adept in love, feels that his spirit
accords with hers: as soon as he finds that his eyes lay hold
upon her image and carry it to his heart; and that his soul
begins to contemplate her with pleasure and to feel that influence
within which stirs and warms it little by little; and that those
quick spirits which shine out through the eyes continually add
fresh tinder to the fire;—he ought at this first stage to provide a
speedy cure, and arouse his reason, and therewith arm the
fortress of his heart, and so shut the way to sense and appetite
that they cannot enter there by force or trickery. Thus, if the
flame is extinguished, the danger is extinguished also; but if it
survives or grows, then the Courtier, feeling himself caught,
must resolve on shunning wholly every stain of vulgar love, and
thus enter on the path of divine love, with reason for guide. And
first he must consider that the body wherein this beauty shines
is not the fountain whence it springs, but rather that beauty
(being an incorporeal thing and, as we have said, a heavenly
beam) loses much of its dignity when it finds itself joined to vile
and corruptible matter; for the more perfect it is the less it partakes
thereof, and is most perfect when wholly separate therefrom.
And he must consider that just as one cannot hear with
the palate or smell with the ears, so too can beauty in no wise
be enjoyed, nor can the desire which it excites in our minds
be satisfied, by means of touch, but by that sense of which this
beauty is the very object, namely, the power of vision.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore let him shun the blind judgment of sense, and with
his eyes enjoy the splendour of his lady, her grace, her amourous
sparkle, the laughs, the ways and all the other pleasant ornaments
of her beauty. Likewise with his hearing let him enjoy
the sweetness of her voice, the concord of her words, the harmony
of her music (if his beloved be a musician). Thus will he
feed his soul on sweetest food by means of these two senses—which
have little of the corporeal and are ministers of reason—without
passing in his desire for the body to any appetite less
than seemly.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Next let him obey, please and honour his lady with all reverence,
and hold her dearer than himself, and prefer her convenience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>and pleasures to his own, and love in her not less the
beauty of mind than that of body. Therefore let him take care
not to leave her to fall into any kind of errour, but by admonition
and good advice let him always seek to lead her on to modesty,
to temperance, to true chastity, and see to it that no thoughts
find place in her except those that are pure and free from every
stain of vice; and by thus sowing virtue in the garden of her fair
mind, he will gather fruits of fairest behaviour too, and will taste
them with wonderful delight. And this will be the true engendering
and manifesting of beauty in beauty, which by some is
said to be the end of love.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In such fashion will our Courtier be most acceptable to his
lady, and she will always show herself obedient, sweet and affable
to him, and as desirous of pleasing him as of being loved by him;
and the wishes of both will be most virtuous and harmonious,
and they themselves will thus be very happy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>63.—Here my lord Morello said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“To engender beauty in beauty, forsooth, would be to beget a
beautiful child in a beautiful woman; and pleasing him in this
would seem to me a much clearer token that she loved her lover
than treating him with the affability of which you speak.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Bembo laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“You must not go beyond bounds, my lord Morello; nor does
a woman give small token of her love when she gives her lover
her beauty, which is so precious a thing, and by the ways that
are the avenues to her soul (that is, sight and hearing) sends the
glances of her eyes, the image of her face, her voice, her words,
which strike home to the lover’s heart and give him proof of her
love.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Morello said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Glances and words may be, and often are, false proofs; therefore
he who has no better pledge of love is, in my judgment, far
from sure; and truly I quite expected you to make this lady of
yours a little more courteous and generous to the Courtier than
my lord Magnifico made his; but methinks that both of you are
in like case with those judges who pronounce sentence against
their friends for the sake of appearing wise.”</p>

<p class='c001'>64.—Bembo said:</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>“I am very willing that this lady should be much more courteous
to my unyouthful Courtier, than my lord Magnifico’s is to
the youthful Courtier; and with reason, for my Courtier will
desire only seemly things, and therefore the lady can grant him
all of them without blame; while my lord Magnifico’s lady, who
is not so sure of the youthful Courtier’s modesty, ought to grant
him only seemly things, and to refuse him the unseemly. Hence
my Courtier, to whom is granted what he asks, is more happy
than the other, to whom part is granted and part refused.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And to the end that you may still better understand that
rational love is happier than sensual, I say that the same things
ought sometimes to be refused in sensual love and granted in
rational love, because they are unseemly in the one and seemly
in the other. Thus, to please her worthy lover, besides granting
him pleasant smiles, familiar and secret discourse, and leave to
joke and jest with her and to touch her hand, the lady may in
reason even go so far as kissing without blame, which is not
permitted in sensual love according to my lord Magnifico’s rules.
For since the kiss is the union of body and soul, there is danger
lest the sensual lover incline more in the direction of the body
than in that of the soul; while the rational lover perceives that
although the mouth is part of the body, yet it gives issue to
words, which are interpreters of the soul, and to that inward
breath which is itself even called soul. Hence a man delights
to join his mouth to that of his beloved in a kiss, not in order to
arouse any unseemly desire in him, but because he feels that
bond to be the opening of a passage between their souls, which,
being each drawn by desire for the other, pour themselves each
into the other’s body by turn, and so commingle that each has
two souls, and a single soul (thus composed of these two) rules
as it were over two bodies. Hence the kiss may be oftener said
to be a joining of soul than of body, because it has such power
over the soul that it draws her to itself and separates her from
the body. On this account all chaste lovers desire to kiss as a
joining of the soul; and thus the divinely enamoured Plato says
that in kissing the soul came to his lips to escape his body. And
since the separation of the soul from things material, and its
complete union with things spiritual, may be denoted by the kiss,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>Solomon, in his divine book of the Song, says: ‘Let him kiss me
with the kiss of his mouth,’ to express desire that his soul might
be so transported with divine love to the contemplation of celestial
beauty, that by joining closely therewith she might forsake
the body.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.65'></a>65.—Everyone gave closest heed to Bembo’s discourse; and he,
having made a little pause and seeing that no one else spoke,
said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“As you have made me begin to teach our unyouthful Courtier
happy love, I fain would lead him a little farther; for it is very
dangerous to stop at this stage, seeing that the soul is very prone
to the senses, as has many times been said; and although reason
and argument choose well and perceive that beauty does not
spring from the body, and although they therefore put a bridle
upon unseemly desires, still, always contemplating beauty in the
body often perverts sound judgment. And even if no other evil
flowed therefrom, absence from the beloved object brings much
suffering with it, because the influence of her beauty gives the
lover wonderful delight when she is present, and by warming his
heart wakens and melts certain dormant and frozen forces in his
soul, which (being nourished by the warmth of love) spread and
blossom about his heart, and send forth through the eyes those
spirits that are very subtle vapours made of the purest and
brightest part of the blood, which receive the image of her
beauty and fashion it with a thousand various ornaments. Hence
the soul delights, and trembles with awe and yet rejoices, and as
in a stupour feels not only pleasure, but that fear and reverence
which we are wont to have for sacred things, and speaks of being
in paradise.</p>

<p class='c001'>66.—“Therefore the lover who considers beauty in the body
only, loses this blessing and felicity as soon as his beloved lady
by her absence leaves his eyes without their splendour, and his
soul consequently widowed of its blessing. Because, her beauty
being far away, that amourous influence does not warm his heart
as it did in her presence; wherefore his pores become arid and
dry, and still the memory of her beauty stirs a little those forces
of his soul, so that they seek to scatter abroad the spirits; and
these, finding the ways shut, have no exit, and yet seek to issue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>forth; and thus hemmed in by those goads, they sting the soul and
give it keenest suffering, as in the case of children when the teeth
begin to come through the tender gums. And from this proceed
the tears, the sighs, the anguish and the torments of lovers, because
the soul is ever in affliction and travail, and becomes almost
raging until her dear beauty appears to it again; and then it suddenly
is calmed and breathes, and all intent upon that beauty it
feeds on sweetest food, nor would ever part from so delightful a
spectacle.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hence, to escape the torment of this absence and to enjoy
beauty without suffering, there is need that the Courtier should,
with the aid of reason, wholly turn his desire from the body to the
beauty alone, and contemplate it in itself simple and pure, as far
as he can, and fashion it in his imagination apart from all matter;
and thus make it lovely and dear to his soul, and enjoy it there,
and have it with him day and night, in every time and place, without
fear of ever losing it; bearing always in mind that the body
is something very different from beauty, and not only does not
enhance it, but diminishes its perfection.</p>

<p class='c001'>“In this wise will our unyouthful Courtier be beyond all the
bitterness and calamities that the young nearly always feel: such
as jealousies, suspicions, disdainings, angers, despairings, and
certain furies full of madness whereby they are often led into
such errour that some of them not only beat the women whom
they love, but deprive themselves of life. He will do no injury
to the husband, father, brothers or kinsfolk of his beloved lady;
he will put no infamy upon her; he will never be forced to bridle
his eyes and tongue with such difficulty in order not to disclose
his desires to others, or to endure suffering at partings or absences;—because
he will always carry his precious treasure with him
shut up in his heart, and also by force of his imagination he will
inwardly fashion her beauty much more beautiful than in fact it
is.</p>

<p class='c001'>67.—“But besides these blessings the lover will find another
much greater still, if he will employ this love as a step to mount
to one much higher; which he will succeed in doing if he continually
considers within himself how narrow a restraint it is to
be always occupied in contemplating the beauty of one body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>only; and therefore, in order to escape such close bounds as
these, in his thought he will little by little add so many ornaments,
that by heaping all beauties together he will form an
universal concept, and will reduce the multitude of these beauties
to the unity of that single beauty which is spread over human
nature at large. In this way he will no longer contemplate
the particular beauty of one woman, but that universal beauty
which adorns all bodies; and thus, bewildered by this greater
light, he will not heed the lesser, and glowing with a purer flame,
he will esteem lightly that which at first he so greatly prized.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This stage of love, although it be very noble and such as few
attain, still cannot be called perfect; for since the imagination is
merely a corporeal faculty and has no perception except through
those means that are furnished it by the senses, it is not wholly
purged of material darkness; and hence, although it considers
this universal beauty in the abstract and intrinsically, yet it does
not discern that beauty very clearly or without some ambiguity,
because of the likeness which phantoms bear to substance.
Thus those who attain this love are like tender birds beginning
to put on feathers, which, although with their frail wings they
lift themselves a little in flight, yet dare not go far from their
nest or trust themselves to the winds and open sky.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.68'></a>68.—“Therefore when our Courtier shall have reached this
goal, although he may be called a very happy lover by comparison
with those who are plunged in the misery of sensual love,
still I would have him not rest content, but press boldly on
following along the lofty path after the guide who leads him to
the goal of true felicity. And thus, instead of going outside
himself in thought (as all must needs do who choose to contemplate
bodily beauty only), let him have recourse to himself, in
order to contemplate that beauty which is seen by the eyes
of the mind, which begin to be sharp and clear when those
of the body lose the flower of their loveliness. Then the soul,—freed
from vice, purged by studies of true philosophy, versed in
spiritual life, and practised in matters of the intellect, devoted to
the contemplation of her own substance,—as if awakened from
deepest sleep, opens those eyes which all possess but few use,
and sees in herself a ray of that light which is the true image of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>the angelic beauty communicated to her, and of which she then
communicates a faint shadow to the body. Grown blind to
things earthly, the soul thus becomes very keen-sighted to things
heavenly; and sometimes, when the motive forces of the body
are absorbed by earnest contemplation or fettered by sleep,
being unhampered by them, she is conscious of a certain far-off
perfume of true angelic beauty, and ravished by the splendour
of that light, she begins to kindle and pursues it so eagerly that
she almost becomes phrensied with desire to unite herself to that
beauty, thinking that she has found God’s footstep, in the contemplation
of which she seeks to rest as in her beatific end. And
thus, glowing in this most happy flame, she rises to her noblest
part, which is the intellect; and here, no longer darkened by the
gloomy night of things earthly, she sees the divine beauty; but
still she does not yet quite enjoy it perfectly, because she contemplates
it in her own particular intellect only, which cannot
be capable of the vast universal beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Wherefore, not well content with this boon, love gives the
soul a greater felicity; for just as from the particular beauty of
one body it guides her to the universal beauty of all bodies, so in
the highest stage of perfection it guides her from the particular
to the universal intellect. Hence the soul, kindled by the most
sacred fire of true divine love, flies to unite herself with the
angelic nature, and not only quite forsakes sense, but has
no longer need of reason’s discourse; for, changed into an angel,
she understands all things intelligible, and without veil or cloud
views the wide sea of pure divine beauty, and receives it into
herself, and enjoys that supreme felicity of which the senses are
incapable.</p>

<p class='c001'>69.—“If, then, the beauties which with these dim eyes of ours we
daily see in corruptible bodies (but which are naught but dreams
and faintest shadows of beauty) seem to us so fair and gracious
that they often kindle most ardent fire in us, and of such delight
that we deem no felicity able to equal that which we sometimes
feel at a single glance coming to us from a woman’s beloved
eyes,—what happy wonder, what blessed awe, shall we think is
that which fills the souls that attain to the vision of divine
beauty! What sweet flame, what delightful burning, must that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>be thought which springs from the fountain of supreme and
true beauty!—which is the source of every other beauty, which
never waxes nor wanes: ever fair, and of its own self most
simple in every part alike; like only to itself, and partaking
of none other; but fair in such wise that all other fair things are
fair because they derive their beauty from it.</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is that beauty identical with highest good, which by its
light calls and attracts all things to itself, and not only gives intellect
to the intellectual, reason to the rational, sense and desire
for life to the sensual, but to plants also and to stones communicates
motion and that natural instinct of their quality, as an
imprint of itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Therefore this love is as much greater and happier than the
others, as the cause that moves it is more excellent; and hence,
just as material fire refines gold, so does this most sacred fire in
our souls destroy and consume that which is mortal there, and
quickens and beautifies that celestial part which at first, by reason
of the senses, was dead and buried in them. This is the Pyre
whereon the poets write that Hercules was burned on the crest
of Mount Œta, and by such burning became divine and immortal
after death.<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c016'><sup>[478]</sup></a> This is the Burning Bush of Moses, the Cloven
Tongues of fire, the Fiery Chariot of Elias,<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c016'><sup>[479]</sup></a> which doubles grace
and felicity in the souls of those who are worthy to behold it,
when they leave this earthly baseness and take flight towards
heaven.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Let us, then, direct all the thoughts and forces of our soul to
this most sacred light, which shows us the way that leads to
heaven; and following after it, let us lay aside the passions
wherewith we were clothed at our fall, and by the stairway that
bears the shadow of sensual beauty on its lowest step, let us
mount to the lofty mansion where dwells the heavenly, lovely
and true beauty, which lies hidden in the inmost secret recesses
of God, so that profane eyes cannot behold it. Here we shall
find a most happy end to our desires, true rest from our toil, certain
cure for our miseries, most wholesome medicine for our
diseases, safest refuge from the boisterous storms of this life’s
tempestuous sea.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.70'></a>70.—“What mortal tongue, then, O most holy Love, can praise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>thee worthily? Most fair, most good, most wise, thou springest
from the union of beauty and goodness and divine wisdom, and
abidest in that union, and by that union returnest to that union
as in a circle. Sweetest bond of the universe, joining things
celestial to things terrestrial, thou with benignant sway inclinest
the supernal powers to rule the lower powers, and turning the
minds of mortals to their origin, joinest them thereto. Thou
unitest the elements in concord, movest nature to produce—and
that which is born, to the perpetuation of life. Thou unitest
things that are separate, givest perfection to the imperfect, likeness
to the unlike, friendship to the unfriendly, fruit to the earth,
tranquillity to the sea, vital light to the heavens.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Thou art father of true pleasure, of grace, of peace, of gentleness
and good will, enemy to rustic savagery and sloth—in short,
the beginning and the end of every good. And since thou delightest
to inhabit the flower of beautiful bodies and beautiful
souls, and thence sometimes to display thyself a little to the eyes
and minds of those who are worthy to behold thee, methinks
that now thy abode is here among us.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Deign, then, O Lord, to hear our prayers, pour thyself upon
our hearts, and with the splendour of thy most holy fire illumine
our darkness and, like a trusted guide, in this blind labyrinth show
us the true path. Correct the falseness of our senses, and after
our long pursuit of vanities give us true and solid good; make us
to inhale those spiritual odours that quicken the powers of the
intellect, and to hear the celestial harmony with such accord that
there may no longer be room in us for any discord of passion; fill
us at that inexhaustible fountain of content which ever delights
and never satiates, and gives a taste of true beatitude to all who
drink of its living and limpid waters; with the beams of thy light
purge our eyes of misty ignorance, to the end that they may no
longer prize mortal beauty, and may know that the things which
first they seemed to see, are not, and that those which they saw
not, really are.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Accept our souls, which are offered thee in sacrifice; burn
them in that living flame which consumes all mortal dross, to the
end that, being wholly separated from the body, they may unite
with divine beauty by a perpetual and very sweet bond, and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>we, being severed from ourselves, may, like true lovers, be able to
transform ourselves into the beloved, and rising above the earth
may be admitted to the angels’ feast, where, fed on ambrosia and
immortal nectar, we may at last die a most happy and living
death, as died of old those ancient fathers whose souls thou, by
the most glowing power of contemplation, didst ravish from the
body and unite with God.”</p>

<p class='c001'>71.—Having thus far spoken, with such vehemence that he almost
seemed transported and beside himself, Bembo remained
silent and motionless, keeping his eyes towards heaven, as if
wrapped in ecstasy; when my lady Emilia, who with the others
had been listening most attentively to his discourse, took him by
the border of his robe, and shaking him a little, said:<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c016'><sup>[480]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>“Have a care, messer Pietro, that with these thoughts your soul,
also, does not forsake your body.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lady,” replied messer Pietro, “that would not be the first
miracle that love has wrought upon me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then my lady Duchess and all the others again began urging
Bembo to continue his discourse: and everyone seemed almost to
feel in his mind a spark of that divine love which inspired the
speaker, and all desired to hear more; but Bembo added:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lords, I have said that which love’s sacred phrensy dictated
to me at the moment; now that it seems to inspire me no
further, I should not know what to say: and I think love is not
willing that its secrets should be further disclosed, or that the
Courtier should pass beyond that stage which it has been pleased
to have me show him; and therefore perhaps it is not permitted
to speak more of this matter.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.72'></a>72.—“Verily,” said my lady Duchess, “if the unyouthful Courtier
should prove able to follow the path that you have shown him,
he ought in all reason to content himself with such great felicity,
and to have no envy of the youthful Courtier.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Then messer Cesare Gonzaga said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“The road which leads to this felicity seems to me so steep that
I believe it is very hard to travel.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Gaspar added:</p>

<p class='c001'>“I believe it is hard for men to travel, but impossible for
women.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>My lady Emilia laughed, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My lord Gaspar, if you return to wronging us so often, I
promise you that you will not be pardoned again.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lord Gaspar replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“No wrong is done you by saying that women’s souls are not
so purged of passion as those of men, nor given to contemplation,
as messer Pietro said those must be who would taste divine love.
Thus we do not read that any woman has had this grace, but
that many men have had it, like Plato, Socrates and Plotinus,<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c016'><sup>[481]</sup></a>
and many others; and so many of our holy Fathers, like St.
Francis, upon whom an ardent spirit of love impressed the most
holy seal of the five wounds:<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c016'><sup>[482]</sup></a> nor could aught but the power of
love lift St. Paul to the vision of those mysteries whereof man
is not allowed to speak;<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c016'><sup>[483]</sup></a> nor show St. Stephen the opened
heavens.”<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c016'><sup>[484]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Here the Magnifico Giuliano replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“In this, women will by no means be outdone by men; for
Socrates himself confesses that all the mysteries of love which
he knew were revealed to him by a woman, who was the famous
Diotima;<a href='#f362' class='c016'><sup>[362]</sup></a> and the angel who wounded St. Francis with the
fire of love, has also made several women of our age worthy of
the same seal. You must remember, too, that St. Mary Magdalen
had many sins forgiven her because she loved much,<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c016'><sup>[485]</sup></a> and
perhaps with no less grace than St. Paul was she many times
lifted to the third heaven by angelic love; and so many others,
who (as I narrated yesterday more at large) for the love of
Christ’s name took no heed of life, nor were afraid of torments or
any manner of death however horrible and cruel it might be;
and they were not old, as messer Pietro would have our Courtier,
but tender and delicate girls, and of that age wherein he says
that sensual love ought to be allowed in men.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='sec4.73'></a>73.—My lord Gaspar began making ready to reply, but my
lady Duchess said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Of this let messer Pietro Bembo be the judge, and let us
abide by his decision whether or not women are as capable
of divine love as men are. But as the controversy between
you might be too long, it will be well to postpone it until to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>“Nay, until this evening,” said messer Cesare Gonzaga.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How until this evening?” said my lady Duchess.</p>

<p class='c001'>Messer Cesare replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Because it is already day;” and he showed her the light that
was beginning to come in through the cracks at the windows.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then everyone rose to his feet in great surprise, for the discussion
did not seem to have lasted longer than usual; but by
reason of having been begun much later, and by its pleasantness,
it had so beguiled the company that they had not perceived the
flight of hours; nor was there anyone who felt the heaviness
of sleep upon his eyes, which nearly always happens when
the accustomed hour of sleep is passed in watching. The windows
having then been opened on that side of the palace which
looks towards the lofty crest of Mount Catria,<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c016'><sup>[486]</sup></a> they saw that a
beautiful dawn of rosy hue was already born in the east, and
that all the stars had vanished save Venus, sweet mistress of the
sky, who holds the bonds of night and day; from which there
seemed to breathe a gentle wind that filled the air with crisp
coolness and began to waken sweet choruses of joyous birds in
the murmuring forests of the hills hard by.</p>

<p class='c001'>So, having reverently taken leave of my lady Duchess, they all
started towards their chambers without light of torches, that of
day being enough for them; and as they were about to quit the
room, my lord Prefect turned to my lady Duchess, and said:</p>

<p class='c001'>“My Lady, to finish the controversy between my lord Gaspar
and my lord Magnifico, we will come with our judge this evening
earlier than we did yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c001'>My lady Emilia replied:</p>

<p class='c001'>“On condition that if my lord Gaspar wishes to accuse women
and put some fresh imputation upon them, as is his wont, he
shall also give bond to sustain his charge, for I account him
a shifty disputant.”</p>

<p>BALDESAR CASTIGLIONE<br />COUNT OF NOVILLARA<br />1478-1529</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c004'>Reduced from Anderson’s photograph (no.2955) of the anonymous portrait in the Corsini
Gallery at Rome. This may possibly be a copy of a second portrait that Raphael is
said to have painted of Castiglione, in 1519.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>
  <h3 class='c002'>PRELIMINARY NOTES</h3>
</div>

<div class='pnote'>

<p class='c019'>Baldesar Castiglione was born on his father’s estate of Casatico in the
Mantuan territory, 6 December 1478. Michelangelo was his senior by four
years; Leo X by three years; Titian by one year; Giorgione and Cesare
Borgia were born in the year of his birth, while his friend Raphael and also
Luther were his juniors by five years.</p>

<p class='c001'>His surname is said to be derived from the little town at which Bonaparte
defeated the Austrians near Mantua in 1796, and which is by some supposed
to have taken its name from <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Castrum Stiliconis</i></span>, Camp of Stilico, a
Roman general of the 4th century. One Tealdo Castiglione was Archbishop
of Milan as early as 1074, from which time the family is often and honourably
mentioned in the annals of northern Italy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Baldesar’s parents were Count Cristoforo Castiglione, a soldier-courtier, and
Luigia Gonzaga, a near kinswoman of the Marquess of Mantua. The boy
studied at Milan,—learning Latin from Giorgio Merula and Greek from
Demetrios Chalcondylas, an erudite Athenian who had fled from Byzantium
about 1447, and of whom another pupil wrote: “It seems to me that in him
are figured all the wisdom, the civility and the elegance of those ancients who
are so famous and so illustrious. Merely seeing him, you fancy you are looking
on Plato; far more when you hear him speak.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Having spent some time at the splendid court of Ludovico Sforza at Milan,
Castiglione lost his father in 1499, and (the Sforzas being expelled the same year)
he returned to Mantua and entered the service of his natural lord, the Marquess
Gianfrancesco Gonzaga; he accompanied this prince to Milan to witness
the entry of Louis XII of France, and afterwards on an expedition to aid
the French in their vain effort to hold the kingdom of Naples against the
Aragonese. When Gonzaga abandoned the French cause (after being defeated
by Ferdinand the Catholic’s “Great Captain,” Consalvo de Cordova,
near the Garigliano in 1503), Castiglione obtained leave to go to Rome, and
there met Duke Guidobaldo di Montefeltro, who had come to pay homage to
the newly elected Pope Julius II. He entered the duke’s service, and soon
became one of the brightest ornaments of that brilliant company of statesmen,
prelates, scholars, poets, wits and ladies, known as the Court of Urbino.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1504 he took part, under Duke Guidobaldo, in the papal siege of Cesena
against the Venetians. The next year he attended the duke on a diplomatic
visit to Rome. In 1506 he was sent to the court of Henry VII of England to
receive the insignia of the Order of the Garter on the duke’s behalf. As appears
from a letter to his mother, he returned to Urbino as early as 5 March 1507,
notwithstanding his mention of himself in The Courtier as still absent
in England at the date (8-11 March) of the dialogues he professes to report at
second hand. In the same year he was sent on a mission to Louis XII at Milan.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>On Guidobaldo’s death in 1508, Castiglione continued in the service of the
new duke, Francesco Maria della Rovere (“my lord Prefect” of <span class='sc'>The Courtier</span>),
who appointed him governor of Gubbio. In the following year he
served in his master’s campaign against the Venetians, and contracted a dangerous
illness, during which he was tenderly nursed by the dowager duchess,
Elisabetta Gonzaga. In 1511 he accompanied the duke to Rome on the occasion
of the latter’s trial for the murder of Cardinal Alidosi, and was active in
Francesco Maria’s successful defence. In 1513 the duke created him Count of
Novillara and gave him an estate of that name, which however he soon lost
through the Medici usurpation of the duchy, and never regained. At the death
of Julius II, Castiglione was ambassador to the sacred college, and continued
in that office during nearly the whole of Leo X's pontificate. His numerous
letters show the variety and importance of the diplomatic business in which
he was engaged.</p>

<p class='c001'>Several plans for his marriage came to nothing, and on one occasion, when
the lady’s father hesitated, the suitor broke off negotiations, saying: “The
wife that I am to take, be she who she may, I desire that she should be given
to me with as good will as I take her withal,—yea, if she were the daughter
of a king.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Pope Leo having in 1516 basely deprived Francesco Maria of the Duchy of
Urbino, Castiglione accepted an invitation to Mantua and there married Ippolita,
daughter of Count Guido Torello di Montechiarugolo and Francesca
Bentivoglio, a daughter of the former ruler of Bologna. This union proved
exceptionally happy and was blessed by three children: a son Camillo, a
daughter Anna, and a second daughter Ippolita, at whose birth the young
mother lost her life in 1520. His son attained the age of eighty years, and is
said to have been the true embodiment of the qualities described in <span class='sc'>The
Courtier</span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Castiglione resided alternately at Mantua and at Rome, where he served as
Mantuan ambassador, and where his learning, wit, taste, gentle disposition
and integrity earned for him an almost unique eminence at the papal court.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1524 he was sent by Pope Clement VII as ambassador to the Emperor
Charles V (who was waging war against the French in Italy), but while his
counsel and high qualities were appreciated, he was too honest a man to cope
with the tortuous politics of the time, and proved unable to avert the capture
and sack of Rome (1527) or the imprisonment of the pope. These catastrophes,
together with a malicious and easily disproved charge of treason brought
against him, preyed upon his health, and despite the many honours conferred
upon him by Charles, he failed to rally, and finally died at Toledo, 7 February
1529, without again seeing his native land. His body was afterwards brought
to Italy and buried in the church of the Madonna delle Grazie near Mantua,
where his tomb was erected from designs by his young friend Giulio Romano.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides <span class='sc'>The Courtier</span>, his writings comprise: <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Tirsi</cite></span>, an eclogue of fifty-five
stanzas in <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>ottava rima</i></span>, written and recited at the court of Urbino for the
carnival of 1506; a prologue and epilogue for his friend Bibbiena’s <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Calandra</cite></span>;
a few Italian lyrics of moderate merit; and some better Latin elegies and epigrams;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>nearly all composed during his embassy at Rome. A large number
of his letters also have been preserved.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Reduced from a water-colour drawing made by the architect Patricolo and the painter
Zanetti from the monument designed by Giulio Pippi, better known as Giulio Romano,
(1492-1546). The water-mark of the paper on which this volume is printed is copied
from a drawing, by Zanetti, of Castiglione’s arms as they appear in the upper left-hand
panel of the monument.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>His fine character is reflected in that of his Courtier, who (as Symonds says)
“is, with one or two points of immaterial difference, a modern gentleman, such
as all men of education at the present day would wish to be.” It may perhaps
aid the reader to realize the time in which the author lived, to recall that when
Castiglione was born, printing had been practised in Italy for thirteen years,
that the earliest Greek grammar had been printed two years, that America
was discovered when he was a boy, that the Reformation began when he was
in the prime of life, and that the Lutherans were first called Protestants in the
year of his death.</p>

</div>

<div class='pnote'>

<p class='c001'>The first (Aldine) edition of <span class='sc'>The Courtier</span> was issued thirteen years
after the death of Teob<em>aldo</em> Manucci, the illustrious founder of the press that
continued to bear his name, and consisted of one thousand and thirty-one
copies, of which thirty were on large paper and one on vellum. It is a small
folio of one hundred and twenty-two leaves, the type-page measuring almost
precisely nine and one-quarter inches by five and one-eighth inches. In its
ordinary form the book can hardly be called rare, as in 1895 the present translator
secured a good copy from Leipsic for forty-five francs.</p>

</div>

<div class='pnote'>

<p class='c001'>The earliest Spanish translator, <span class='sc'>Boscan</span>, (born at Barcelona about 1493;
died in France about 1542), was of gentle birth. Early becoming a soldier, he
served with credit in Charles V's Italian campaigns, and thus acquired familiarity
with the language and literature of Italy. He is said to have known
Castiglione personally. Having been for some time tutor to the young prince
who was later known as the Duke of Alva, he married and devoted the rest of
his short life to letters. As a writer he is best known as the founder of the
Italian poetical school in Spain. Ticknor says that Boscan’s version of <span class='sc'>The
Courtier</span> hardly professes to be literal, but that perhaps nothing in Castilian
prose of an earlier date is written in so classical and finished a style.
It has been often reprinted (as recently as 1873), and was found useful by the
present translator in doubtful passages.</p>

</div>

<div class='pnote'>

<p class='c001'>The earliest French translator, <span class='sc'>Colin</span>, (died 1547), was a native of Auxerre
and enjoyed the favour of Francis I, whom he served as reader and almoner,
and who bestowed upon him the abbotship of St. Ambrose at Tours, as well
as other ecclesiastical offices. In his prosperity he showed much kindness to
his less fortunate brother authors, but he was too free of speech to be permanently
successful as a courtier, and lost his preferments. His translation of
<span class='sc'>The Courtier</span>, which some writers erroneously ascribe to Jean Chaperon,
is little esteemed, was soon issued with corrections by another hand, and then
followed by another French version. He translated also parts of Homer and
Ovid, and composed original verse in Latin and French. For an account of
Castiglione’s influence upon French literature and of his many French imitators,
consult Pietro Toldo’s <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Le Courtisan dans la littérature française et ses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>rapports avec l'œuvre du Castiglione,”</span> (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Archiv für das Studium der Neueren
Sprachen und Litteraturen,</span> C. iv, pp. 75 and 313, and C. v, p. 60).</p>

</div>

<div class='pnote'>

<p class='c001'>The earliest English translator, <span class='sc'>Hoby</span>, (born 1530; died 1566), was the son
of William and Katherine (Forden) Hoby of Herefordshire. Having studied
at Cambridge, he visited France, Italy and other foreign countries. In 1565-6
he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth and sent as ambassador to France, where
he soon died, leaving several children and a widow. This lady was the third
of Sir Anthony Cooke’s five learned daughters, of whom the eldest married Sir
William Cecil (afterwards Lord Burleigh), while the second became the mother
of Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam. Interesting details of Hoby’s life and of the
manners of the time are given in his unpublished diary, preserved in the British
Museum. His version of <span class='sc'>The Courtier</span> was carefully made, and although
rough to our ears and occasionally obscure, it became very popular and was
several times republished. A beautiful reprint of the original edition has
recently been issued (1900), in a scholarly introduction to which Professor
Walter Raleigh traces the influence of the book upon Elizabethan writers.
<span class='sc'>The Courtier</span>, and especially Hoby’s translation of it, are the subject of
a very interesting study by Mary Augusta Scott, Ph.D., printed in the Publications
of the Modern Language Association of America, vol. xvi (1901), no. 4.
In 1570 Roger Ascham wrote in his “Schoolmaster:” “To join learning with
comely exercises, Count Baldesar Castiglione in his book <span class='sc'>Cortegiano</span> doth
trimly teach: which book, advisedly read and diligently followed but one year
at home in England, would do a young gentleman more good, I wis, than three
years’ travel abroad in Italy. And I marvel this book is not more read in the
Court than it is, seeing it is so well translated into English by a worthy gentleman,
Sir Thomas Hobbie, who was many ways well furnished with learning,
and very expert in knowledge of divers tongues.”</p>

</div>

<div class='pnote'>

<p class='c001'>Of the first German translator, <span class='sc'>Lorenz Kratzer</span>, little more is known than
that he was an officer of customs at Burckhausen, in Bavaria, from 1565 to
1588, and that he speaks of having devoted to letters the ample leisure which
his duties permitted. Although said to be meritorious, his work can hardly
have gained wide currency, as both Noyse (whose German translation of <span class='sc'>The
Courtier</span> was published at Dilingen in 1593) and a third German translator
(whose version was issued at Frankfort in 1684 under the initials “J. C. L. L. J.”)
seem to have regarded themselves each as the earliest in the field.</p>

</div>

<div class='pnote'>

<p class='c001'>The first Latin translator, <span class='sc'>Turler</span>, (born 1550; died 1602), was a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Doctor
Juris</i></span>, and became burgomaster of his native town of Lössnitz, near Leipsic.
Besides <span class='sc'>The Courtier</span>, he translated several of Machiavelli’s works into
Latin.</p>

<div class='fnote'>

<p class='c019'><a id='f1'></a><b>Note <a href='#r1'>1</a> page 1.</b> Dom <span class='sc'>Miguel de Silva</span>, (born about 1490; died 1556),
was the second son of Diego de Silva and Maria de Ayola, Count and Countess
of Portalegre, a province of central Portugal. Having studied at the universities
of Paris, Siena and Bologna, he was soon called to the court of Emanuel
of Portugal, held various ecclesiastical posts, and was made Bishop of Viseu
in the Province of Beira. As ambassador to Popes Leo X, Adrian VI and
Clement VII, he paid long visits to Rome, where his friendship with Castiglione
probably began. During the twenty years that followed 1521 he served
John III of Portugal as <span lang="es" xml:lang="es"><i>Escribano de la Puridad</i></span>; then, having been made a
cardinal by Paul III, he spent the remainder of his life in the papal service,
died in Rome, and was buried in the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere.
Eminent as a prelate and a diplomatist, he also enjoyed no small repute as an
author and an elegant Latinist.</p>

</div>

<div class='fnote'>

<p class='c001'><a id='f2'></a><b>Note <a href='#r2'>2</a> page 1</b>. <span class='sc'>Guidobaldo di Montefeltro</span>, Duke of Urbino, (born
1472; died 1508), was the only son of Duke Federico di Montefeltro and
Battista Sforza, an accomplished niece of the first Sforza duke of Milan. Precocious
as a child, he was elaborately yet judiciously educated, and much of
the praise bestowed upon him in <span class='sc'>The Courtier</span> is shown by contemporary
evidence to have been just. On his father’s death in 1482, both he and his State
were confided to his cousin Ubaldini (see note <a href='#f273'>273</a>), who seems to have been
loyal to the trust, although next heir to the duchy. From records that have
survived, Dennistoun extracts some details of the young duke’s court: “To all
persons composing the ducal household, unexceptionable manners were indispensable.
In those of higher rank there were further required competent talents
and learning, a grave deportment, and fluency of speech. The servants
must be of steady habits and respectable character; regular in all private
transactions; of good address, modest and graceful; willing and neat handed
in their service. There is likewise inculcated the most scrupulous personal
cleanliness, especially of the hands, with particular injunctions as to frequent
ablutions, and extraordinary precautions against the unpleasant effects of hot
weather on their persons and clothing; in case of need, medical treatment is
enjoined to correct the breath. Those who wore livery had two suits a year,
generally of fustian, though to some silk doublets were given for summer use.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1489 Guidobaldo married Elisabetta Gonzaga, a sister of the Marquess of
Mantua. All hopes, however, of an heir were soon abandoned, apparently
owing to the young duke’s physical infirmities, which were increased by over
exercise and in time unfitted him for all active occupations. Nevertheless he
was able to take part in the vain resistance to Charles VIII's invasion of Italy,
and later in the expulsion of the French from the kingdom of Naples. While
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>fighting in the service of Pope Alexander VI in 1497, he was taken prisoner
and forced to pay a ransom of 30,000 ducats, a sum then equivalent to about
twice that number of modern pounds sterling, and raised only at the sacrifice
of his duchess’s jewels. In 1501 he aided rather than opposed Louis XII's
invasion of Naples.</p>

<p class='c001'>In 1502 the pope’s son Cesare Borgia treacherously seized the Duchy of
Urbino. To spare his people bloodshed and ruin, Guidobaldo fled in disguise
to his brother-in-law at Mantua, and after a vain appeal to Louis XII, found
an honourable asylum at Venice. In the same year he regained his dominions
for a short time, but was again forced to take flight. On the death of Alexander
VI (August 1503), Cesare’s power crumbled, Guidobaldo easily recovered
his duchy, and his position was soon assured by the election of Julius II,
who was not only his personal friend, but also the brother of his sister Giovanna’s
husband. In 1504 he formally adopted as his heir this sister’s son,
Francesco Maria della Rovere, and (as we have seen) took into his service the
future author of <span class='sc'>The Courtier</span>. His learning, amiability and munificence
attracted choice spirits to his court, which came to be regarded as the first in
Italy. Pope Julius was splendidly entertained there on his way both to and
from his Bologna campaign, and the Courtier dialogues are represented as
taking place immediately after his departure for Rome in March 1507.</p>

<p class='c001'>Long an invalid, Guidobaldo became more and more a martyr to his gout,
which was aggravated by a season of exceptional drought and cold and brought
him final relief from suffering in April 1508. His fame rests, not upon his
military and political achievements, but upon the beauty of his character, the
variety of his intellectual accomplishments, the patience with which he
endured reverses, illness and forced inaction, and upon the culture and
refinement that characterized his court.</p>

</div>

<div class='fnote'>

<p class='c001'><a id='f3'></a><b>Note <a href='#r3'>3</a> page 1.</b> <span class='sc'>Francesco Maria della Rovere</span>, Duke of Urbino, (born
1490; died 1538), was the son of Giovanni della Rovere and Duke Guidobaldo’s
sister Giovanna di Montefeltro. Giovanni was a nephew of Pope Sixtus IV
(who had made him Prefect of Rome), and a younger brother of Cardinal
Giuliano della Rovere, afterwards Pope Julius II.</p>

<p class='c001'>On his father’s death in 1501, Francesco was brought to the court of his
uncle Guidobaldo, who secured for him a renewal of the Prefecture and superintended
his education. In <span class='sc'>The Courtier</span> he appears as “my lord Prefect.”
During the Borgian usurpation of the duchy, he found refuge at the court of
Louis XII; and soon after the fall of the Borgias and his uncle Julius II's accession,
he was adopted as Guidobaldo’s heir, while through the mediation of
Castiglione a marriage was arranged for him with Eleanora, daughter to the
Marquess of Mantua and niece to the Duchess of Urbino. He now resided
chiefly with his uncle, acquainting himself with his future subjects and duties.
Although he possessed many of the good qualities ascribed to him in <span class='sc'>The
Courtier</span>, his temper was ungovernable, and before reaching the age of
eighteen he slew one of the members of the court, who was accused of
seducing his sister.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>Having become duke in 1508, he was married on Christmas Eve of that
year. In the following spring he commanded the papal forces in the League
of Cambray, and despite the obstacles put in his way by his colleague Cardinal
Alidosi (see note <a href='#f268'>268</a>), he soon reduced the Romagna towns, the recovery of
which from Venice was Julius II's chief object in forming the league. In a
later campaign against the French, Bologna was lost to the Church (1511)
through the treachery of Alidosi, who craftily contrived to have the blame fall
upon Francesco, and was murdered by the latter at Ravenna. After a long
trial before six cardinals, in which ample proof of the dead man’s treason was
presented, and an eloquent appeal made by Beroaldo (see note <a href='#f235'>235</a>),—the
young duke was acquitted and restored to the pope’s favour.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although both Francesco and his predecessor had generously befriended
the Medici during their exile from Florence (1494-1512), Leo X (Giovanni de'
Medici) seized his duchy in 1516, to bestow it on a nephew, Lorenzo de' Medici.
It is needless to speak here of Francesco’s restoration in 1521, of his failure to
relieve Pope Clement VII when Rome was sacked in 1527, or of his later life.</p>

<p class='c001'>While small in person, Francesco was active and well formed. His manners
were gentle and his character forgiving, in spite of his fiery temper.
Strict in religious observances and an enemy to blasphemous language, he
was also creditably intolerant of those outrages upon womanly honour with
which war was then fraught. He was famous chiefly as a soldier, and by so
competent a judge as the Emperor Charles V was regarded as master of the
military science of his day.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='f4'></a><b>Note <a href='#r4'>4</a> page 1.</b> This disclaimer of careful authorship is not to be taken too
literally. At least a draft of Books I-III seems to have been made at Urbino
between April 1508 and May 1509, while Book IV was probably written at
Rome in the earlier part of the interval between September 1513 and March
1516. Castiglione apparently continued to revise his work until 1518, when he

<p class='c001'><a id='f6'></a><b>Note <a href='#r6'>6</a> page 1.</b> <span class='sc'>Vittoria Colonna</span>, (born 1490; died 1547), was the daughter
of Fabrizio Colonna (grand-nephew of Pope Martin V) and Agnese di
Montefeltro, a sister of Duke Guidobaldo. At the age of four she was betrothed
to the Marquess of Pescara, whom she married in her nineteenth year at
Ischia (the fief and residence of his family), and who afterwards became a
famous soldier. During his long absences in the field, she consoled herself
with books, and after his death in 1525, her widowhood was spent in retirement
and finally in semi-monastic seclusion at Rome. The time spared from pious
exercises she devoted to study, the composition of poetry, correspondence
with illustrious men of letters, and the society of learned persons. Although
she never became a convert to Protestantism, the liberality of some of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>friends’ belief exposed her to ecclesiastical censure in her old age. Her celebrated
friendship with Michelangelo began when he was past sixty and she
had nearly reached fifty years. They frequently exchanged verses, and he is
said to have visited her on her death-bed. Her poems are chiefly sonnets to
the memory of her husband or verses on sacred and moral subjects.</p>

</div>

<div class='fnote'>

<p class='c001'><a id='f7'></a><b>Note <a href='#r7'>7</a> page 7.</b> The following passage is from a letter written by Castiglione
to the Marchioness: “I am the more deeply obliged to your Ladyship, because
the necessity you have put me under, of sending the book at once to the printer,
relieves me from the trouble of adding many things that I had already prepared
in my mind,—things (I need hardly say) of little import, like the rest of the
book; so that your Ladyship has saved the reader from tedium, and the author
from blame.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Despite the many decrees of popes, emperors and other potentates, literary
piracy seems to have been quite as common in Castiglione’s time as in ours.
He was obviously none too prompt in his precautions, as an apparently unauthorized
edition of <span class='sc'>The Courtier</span> was issued at Florence by the heirs of
Filippo di Giunta in the October following its first publication at Venice in
April 1528.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='f8'></a><b>Note <a href='#r8'>8</a> page 8.</b> <span class='sc'>Alfonso Ariosto</span>, (died 1526), was a cousin of the poet
Ludovico. Little more seems to be known of him than that his father’s name
was Bonifazio, that he was a gentle cavalier and brave soldier in the service of
the Este family, and that he was a friend of Castiglione and of Bembo. His name
appears at the head of each of the four dialogues composing <span class='sc'>The Courtier</span>,
and they purport to have been written at his suggestion. Señor A. M. Fabié,
in his notes to the 1873 reprint of Boscan’s translation, affirms that Alfonso
Ariosto had nothing to do with the poet Ludovico, belonged to a noble
Bolognese family, and enjoyed much favour at the court of Francis I of
France.</p>

<div class='fnote'>

<p class='c001'><a id='f9'></a><b>Note <a href='#r9'>9</a> page 9.</b> <span class='sc'>Giuliano de' Medici</span>, (born 1478; died 1516), was the third
son of Lorenzo the Magnificent and Clarice Orsini. His education seems to
have been for a time entrusted to the famous scholar-poet Poliziano (see note
105). During his family’s exile from Florence (1494-1512), he resided much at
the court of Urbino, where he was known as “the Magnifico Giuliano,” and
where one wing of the great palace was reserved to his use and is still called
by his name. He became the father of a boy afterwards known as Cardinal
Ippolito de' Medici,—the original of Titian’s fine portrait in the Pitti Gallery.
On the restoration of the Medici, Giuliano was placed at the head of affairs in
his native city and succeeded in winning the good will of the Florentines, but
his gentle disposition and love of ease thwarted other ambitious projects formed
for his advancement by his brother Leo X, and he was too grateful to the dukes
of Urbino for their hospitality to accept the pope’s intended appropriation of
their duchy for his benefit. In 1515 he married Filiberta of Savoy and was
created Duke of Nemours by her nephew Francis I of France. In the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>year he was appointed Captain General of the Church, but failing health prevented
his actual service, and he soon died of fever at Florence, not without
suspicion of poison at the hands of his nephew Lorenzo.</p>

<p class='c001'>Several of his sonnets have survived, and are said to show no mean poetic
faculty. Apart, however, from his appearance as an interlocutor in <span class='sc'>The
Courtier</span> and in Bembo’s <cite>Prose</cite>, his memory is best preserved by Michelangelo’s
famous tomb at Florence.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='f10'></a><b>Note <a href='#r10'>10</a> page 2.</b> “<span class='sc'>Messer Bernardo</span>” (<span class='sc'>Dovizi</span>), better known by the
name of his birthplace <span class='sc'>Bibbiena</span>, (born 1470; died 1520), was of humble
parentage. His elder brother Pietro was secretary to Lorenzo de' Medici, and
secured his admission to the Magnifico’s household, where he shared the
education of the young Giovanni and became a devoted friend of that future
pope. Following the Medici into exile, he travelled about Europe with Giovanni
and attended Giuliano to Urbino, where he received the warm welcome
always accorded there to such as combined learning with courtly manners.
By the Duke of Urbino he seems to have been so commended to the favour of
Julius II, that he was able to aid Michelangelo in securing part payment for
the Sistine Chapel frescoes, of which payment, however, he accepted five per
cent. as a gift from the painter. At the death of Julius, he was secretary to
his friend Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici, and in that capacity had access to
the conclave, where his adroitness was largely helpful in effecting his patron’s
election as pope. Leo at once made him Cardinal of Santa Maria in Portico
and loaded him with lucrative offices. During the Medicean usurpation of the
Duchy of Urbino, he showed no gratitude for the kindness enjoyed by him at
that court. He became very rich, and was a liberal patron of authors and artists.
Raphael devised to him the house of the architect Bramante, which the
painter had bought for a sum equivalent to about £6,000, and which was afterwards
demolished in extending the piazza in front of St. Peter’s.</p>

<p class='c001'>Besides a large number of his letters, for the most part unpublished, we
have his play, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Calandra</cite></span>, founded upon the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Menæchmi</cite></span> of Plautus and once
esteemed as the earliest Italian prose comedy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although he was bald, and although his friend Raphael’s portrait hardly
justifies the epithet, he was known as the “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Bel Bernardo</i></span>.” A contemporary
MS. in the Vatican describes him as “a facetious character, with no mean
powers of ridicule, and much tact in promoting jocular conversation by his
wit and well-timed jests. He was a great favourite with certain cardinals,
whose chief pursuit was pleasure and the chase, for he thoroughly knew all
their habits and fancies, and was even aware of whatever vicious propensities
they had. He likewise possessed a singular pliancy for flattery, and for obsequiously
accommodating himself to their whims, stooping patiently to be the
butt of insulting and abusive jokes, and shrinking from nothing that could
render him acceptable to them. He also had much readiness in council, and
was perfectly able seasonably to qualify his wit with wisdom, or to dissemble
with singular cunning.” On the other hand, Bembo wrote of him to their
friend Federico Fregoso: “The days seem years until I see him, and enjoy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>the pleasing society, the charming conversation, the wit, the jests, the features
and the affection of that man.”</p>

<div class='fnote'>

<p class='c001'><a id='f11'></a><b>Note <a href='#r11'>11</a> page 2.</b> <span class='sc'>Ottaviano Fregoso</span>, (died 1524), belonged to a noble
Genoese family that had long distinguished itself in public service and had
furnished several doges to the Republic. His parents were Agostino Fregoso
and Gentile di Montefeltro, a half-sister of Duke Guidobaldo. Driven from
Genoa as early as 1497, he entered his uncle’s court at Urbino and rendered
important military services, especially during the struggle with Cesare Borgia,
in which he gallantly defended the fortress of San Leo (see note <a href='#f275'>275</a>), and
was rewarded with the lordship of Santa Agata in the Apennines. In 1506 he
commanded the papal forces for the recovery of Bologna, and later in the League
of Cambray against Venice. In 1513 he succeeded in putting an end to French
domination in Genoa, was elected doge, and ruled so beneficently for two years
that when Francis I regained the city, Fregoso was continued as governor.
In 1522 Genoa was captured and sacked by Spanish and German troops, and
Fregoso given over to the Marquess of Pescara, treated harshly (despite
Castiglione’s intercession on his behalf), and carried to Ischia, where he died.</p>

<p class='c001'>Several stories of his absent-mindedness are narrated by Dennistoun, and
one illustrates the freedom of intercourse at the court of Urbino. His uncle
Guidobaldo appearing one day in a beautiful violet satin jerkin, Ottaviano
exclaimed: “My lord Duke, you really are <em>the</em> handsome Signor!” and then,
on being reproved for flattery, he replied: “I did not mean that you are a man
of worth, though I pronounced you a fine man and a handsome nobleman.”</p>

<div class='fnote'>

<p class='c001'><a id='f12'></a><b>Note <a href='#r12'>12</a> page 2.</b> “<span class='sc'>My lady Duchess</span>,” <span class='sc'>Elisabetta Gonzaga</span>, (born 1471;
died 1526), was the second daughter of the Marquess Federico Gonzaga of
Mantua and Margarita of Bavaria. She married Duke Guidobaldo in 1489.
In 1502 she reluctantly attended the festivities for the marriage, at Ferrara, of
Lucrezia Borgia to Alfonso d'Este, and some of her costumes are thus
described by an eye-witness: On entering Ferrara, she rode a black mule
caparisoned in black velvet embroidered with woven gold, and wore a mantle
of black velvet strewn with triangles of beaten gold, a string of pearls about
her neck, and a cap of gold; another day indoors she wore a mantle of brown
velvet slashed, and caught up with chains of massive gold; another day a
gown of black velvet striped with gold, with a jewelled necklace and diadem;
and still another day, a black velvet robe embroidered with gold ciphers.</p>

<p class='c001'>During the Borgian usurpation of their duchy in the same year, she shared
her husband’s exile at Venice, and on returning to Urbino earlier than Guidobaldo,
she amused herself with a scenic representation of the chief events that
had occurred during their absence. She cared for her husband tenderly in his
illnesses, administered his government wisely when he was called away, and
on his death acted as regent and guardian for his nephew and successor, with
whom she maintained affectionate relations as long as she lived, and from
appropriating whose dominions she strove to the utmost to dissuade Leo X.</p>

<p class='c001'>Next to her husband’s niece by marriage, Emilia Pia (see note <a href='#f37'>37</a>), her closest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>friend seems to have been her brother’s wife, the famous Isabella d'Este (see
note 397), with whom she often travelled and continually corresponded by
letter. Although still young and accounted beautiful at her husband’s death,
she remained faithful to his memory, and the years of her widowhood were
cheered by the companionship of her niece, the young duchess Eleanora of
Urbino (see note <a href='#f432'>432</a>). If we may trust universal contemporary opinion of her
virtues and beauty, the author of <span class='sc'>The Courtier</span> flattered her as little as did
the painter of her portrait in the Uffizi Gallery.</p>

son of a Florentine tradesman and a Frenchwoman with whom his father had
made acquaintance during a business residence at Paris. In early manhood
he engaged in commerce at Naples, and had but little learning in his youth,
although he studied law for a time. Erudition and authorship became the
serious enthusiasm of his life, owing (it is said) to a chance visit to the supposed
tomb of Virgil at Naples. In middle life he began the study of Greek at
his friend Petrarch’s suggestion; and although he never acquired more than
what would now be deemed a superficial knowledge of that language, as a
Hellenist he had no precursor in Italy. An ardent if somewhat unappreciative
admirer of Dante (whose <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Divina Commedia</cite></span> he transcribed with his own hands),
he was the first Italian author to write for the common people, instead of composing
books suited only to the learned and patrician classes. His style was
formed by tireless study of classic models, and became a standard for imitation
by his successors.</p>

Lesbos, but resided at Athens. He was the chief disciple and successor
of Aristotle, and wrote also upon a great variety of subjects other than philosophy.
His best known work, the “Characters,” is a collection of sprightly sketches
of human types. La Bruyère’s famous book of the same name was originally
a mere translation from Theophrastus. The incident mentioned in the text is
thus described in Cicero’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Brutus</cite></span>: “When he asked a certain old woman for

This visit is known to have lasted from 3 March to 7 March 1507. Castiglione
returned from England as early as 5 March, on which date he wrote

1482), was a natural son of Count Guidantonio di Montefeltro, as appears from
the act of legitimation issued by Pope Martin V and also from his father’s
testament, by virtue whereof (as well as by the choice of the people) he succeeded
his half-brother Count Oddantonio in 1444. In his boyhood he resided
fifteen months as a hostage at Venice. Later he studied the theory and practice
of war at the Mantuan court, and was trained in the humanities by the
famous Vittorino da Feltre. In 1437 he married Gentile Brancaleone, who
died childless in 1457. Nearly the whole of his life was spent in military service,
as paid ally, now of one prince, now of another. In this capacity he
became not only the most noted commander of his time, but always displayed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>perfect and exceptional fidelity to the causes that he undertook. In 1450 he
lost an eye and suffered a fracture of the nose in a tournament; contemporary
portraits represent his features in profile. In 1454 he began the construction
of the great palace at Urbino. In 1460, at the suggestion of Francesco Sforza
(whom he had aided to become Duke of Milan), he married the latter’s accomplished
niece Battista Sforza, who bore him seven daughters and one son,
Guidobaldo. In 1474 he was made Duke of Urbino and appointed Captain
General of the Church by Pope Sixtus IV, and was unanimously elected a
Knight of the Garter. He died of fever contracted during military operations
in the malarial country near Ferrara. The vast sums spent by him on public
buildings, art objects and books, and upon the maintenance of his splendid
household, were not extorted from his subjects, but were received from foreign
states in return for war service. Thus at the close of his life he drew a yearly
stipend equivalent to about £330,000.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not easy to draw a picture of his character that shall seem unflattered.
Vespasiano, who by years of labour collected his famous library for him, says
that his “establishment was conducted with the regularity of a religious fraternity,
rather than like a military household. Gambling and profanity were
unknown, and singular decorum of language was observed, whilst many noble
youths, sent there to learn good manners and military discipline, were reared
under the most exemplary tuition. He regarded his subjects as his children,
and was at all times accessible to hear them personally state their petitions,
being careful to give answers without unnecessary delay. He walked freely
about the streets, entering their shops and workrooms, and enquiring into
their circumstances with paternal interest.... In summer he was in the
saddle at dawn, and rode three or four miles into the country with half-a-dozen
of his court ... reaching home again when others were just up. After mass,
he went into an open garden and gave audience to all comers until breakfast-time.
When at table, he listened to the Latin historians, chiefly Livy, except
in Lent, when some religious book was read, anyone being free to enter the
hall and speak with him then. His fare was plain and substantial, denying
himself sweet dishes and wine, except drinks of pomegranates, cherries, apples,
or other fruits. After dinner and supper, an able judge of appeal stated in
Latin the causes brought before him, on which the duke gave judgment in
that language;... When his mid-day meal was finished, if no one appeared
to ask audience, he retired to his closet and transacted private business, or
listened to reading until evening approached, when he generally walked out,
giving patient ear to all who accosted him in the streets. He then occasionally
visited ... a meadow belonging to the Franciscans, where thirty or
forty of the youths brought up in his court stripped their doublets, and played
at throwing the bar, or at wrestling, or ball. This was a fine sight, which the
duke much enjoyed, encouraging the lads, and listening freely to all until
supper-time. When that and the audiences were over, he repaired to a private
apartment with his principal courtiers, whom, after some familiar talk,
he would dismiss to bed, taxing them with their sluggish indulgence of a
morning.”</p>

eldest son of Ferdinand I and Isabelle de Clermont. As Duke of Calabria,
commanding the papal forces, he defeated the Florentine league in 1479, and
in 1481 drove the Turks out of southern Italy. On his father’s death in 1494,
he succeeded to the crown of Naples; but having rendered himself obnoxious
to his subjects, he abdicated in favour of his son Ferdinand just before the
arrival of Charles VIII of France, and took refuge in a Sicilian convent, where
he soon died, tortured by remorse for the hideous cruelties that he had perpetrated.
His wife was Ippolita Maria, daughter of the first Sforza duke of
Milan; while his daughter Isabella’s marriage to Giangaleazzo Sforza, the
rightful duke, and the usurpation of the latter’s uncle Ludovico “il Moro”
(see note <a href='#f302'>302</a>), became the immediate cause of the first French invasion of

Ferdinand the Catholic’s famous general Consalvo de Cordova, to regain his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>dominions, but died a few weeks later. He seems to have had no lack of courage;

the son of Giuffredo (or Alfonso) Lenzuoli and Juana (or Isabella) Borgia, a
sister of Pope Calixtus III, by whom the youth was adopted and whose surname
he assumed. He was elected pope in 1492 through bribery, and while
striving to increase the temporal power of the Church, directed his chief efforts
towards the establishment of a great hereditary dominion for his family. Of
his five children, two (Cesare and Lucrezia) played important parts in his plan.
In 1495 he joined the league which forced Charles VIII to retire from Italy,
although it had been partly at his instigation that the French invaded the
peninsula. In 1498 Savonarola was burned at Florence by his orders. In
1501 he instituted the ecclesiastical censorship of books. He is believed to
have died from accidentally taking a poison designed by him for a rich cardinal
whose possessions he wished to seize. His private life was disgraced by
orgies, of which the details are unfit for repetition. His contemporary Machiavelli
says: “His entire occupation, his only thought, was deception, and he
always found victims. Never was there a man with more effrontery in assertion,
more ready to add oaths to his promises, or to break them.” While Sismondi
terms him “the most odious, the most publicly scandalous, and the
most wicked of all the miscreants who ever misused sacred authority to outrage
and degrade mankind.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='f34'></a><b>Note <a href='#r34'>34</a> page 10.</b> Pope <span class='sc'>Julius II</span>, (born 1443; died 1513), was Giuliano, the
second son of Raffaele della Rovere (only brother of Pope Sixtus IV) and Teodora
Menerola. Made a cardinal soon after his uncle’s election, he was loaded
with sees and offices, including the legateship of Picene and Avignon, which
latter occasioned his prolonged absence from Italy and afforded him an escape
from the wiles of his inveterate enemy Alexander VI. The outrages with
which Alexander sought to punish his sturdy opposition to the scandals of the
Borgian court, aroused in him a fierceness of spirit that was alien to the seeming
mildness of his early character and became the bane of his own pontificate.
His younger brother Giovanni married a sister of Duke Guidobaldo, a union
that cemented the friendship between the two families and furnished the
Duchy of Urbino an heir in the person of Francesco Maria della Rovere.
When Julius engaged Michelangelo to design his tomb, the old basilica of St.
Peter’s was found too small to contain it, whereupon the pontiff is said to have
decreed that a new church be built to receive it, and blessed the laying of the
first stone shortly before setting out on his campaign against Bologna in 1506.
In 1508 he formed the League of Cambray for the recovery of certain papal
fiefs appropriated by Venice at the time of Cesare Borgia’s downfall, and in
1511 the so-called Holy League for the expulsion of the French from Italy.
Italian unity was the unavowed but real goal at which his policy aimed.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>Although a munificent patron of art and letters, Julius was frugal and severe,—a
man of action rather than a scholar or theologian. In giving Michelangelo
directions for the huge bronze statue at Bologna, he said: “Put a sword in my
hand; of letters I know nothing.” Another of his reported sayings is: “If we
are not ourselves pious, why should we prevent others from being so?”</p>

<p class='c001'>From his tutor Odasio of Padua, we learn that in his boyhood Guidobaldo

Italian poets, and showed peculiar aptitude for philosophy and history.</p>

Marco Pio, one of the lords of Carpi. Her brother Giberto married a natural
daughter of Cardinal Ippolito d'Este (see note <a href='#f64'>64</a>), while her cousin Alberto
Pio (1475-1530) was the pupil and became the patron and financial supporter
of the scholar-printer Aldus Manutius. In 1487 she was married very young
to the studious Count Antonio di Montefeltro (a natural half-brother of Duke
Guidobaldo), who left her a widow in 1500. She resided at Urbino and became
the trusted and inseparable companion of the Duchess Elisabetta, whom she
accompanied on journeys and in exile, ever faithful in misfortune and sorrow.
In the duchess’s testament she was named as legatee and executrix. She
seems to have died without the sacraments of the Church, while discussing
passages of the newly published <span class='sc'>Courtier</span> with Count Ludovico Canossa.
The part taken by her in these dialogues evinces the charm of her winning
manners as well as her possession of a variety of knowledge and graceful accomplishment
rare even in that age of womanly genius. Always ready to lead or
second the learned and sportive pastimes by which the court circle of Urbino
gave zest to their intercourse and polish to their wit, she was of infinite service
to the duchess, whose own acquirements were of a less brilliant kind.</p>

of the invasions of Charles VIII and Louis XII.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='f41'></a><b>Note <a href='#r41'>41</a> page 12.</b> <span class='sc'>Federico Fregoso</span>, (born 1480; died 1541), was a younger
brother of Ottaviano (see note <a href='#f11'>11</a>), and was educated for holy orders under the
direction of his uncle Duke Guidobaldo, at whose court he also perfected himself
in worldly accomplishments. In 1507 Julius II made him Archbishop of
Salerno, in the kingdom of Naples, but, owing to his supposed French sympathies,
he was not allowed to enjoy this benefice, and the next year was put in
charge of the bishopric of Gubbio. In the same year he was sent by Julius
with the latter’s physician to attend Duke Guidobaldo’s death-bed, but arrived
too late. During the nine years that followed his brother’s election as Doge
of Genoa (1513), he by turns commanded the army of the Republic, led her fleet
against the Barbary pirates (whom he routed in their own harbours), and represented
her at the papal court. During the Spanish siege of Genoa in 1522,
he escaped to France, was warmly received by Francis I, and made Abbot of St.
Bénigne at Dijon, where he devoted himself to theological study. In 1528 he
returned to Italy and was appointed to the see of Gubbio. His piety and zeal
for the welfare of his flock won for him the title of “father to the poor and refuge of
the distressed.” In 1539 he was made a cardinal, and two years later died at
Gubbio, being succeeded in that see by his friend Bembo. After his death, a
discourse of his on prayer happening to be reprinted together with a work by
Luther, he was for a time erroneously supposed to have been heretical. He
was a profound student of Hebrew, and an appreciative collector of Provençal
poetry. His own writings are chiefly doctrinal, and his reputation rests rather
upon his friends’ praise of his wit, gentleness, personal accomplishments and
learning, than upon the present value of his extant works.</p>

<div class='fnote'>

<p class='c001'><a id='f42'></a><b>Note <a href='#r42'>42</a> page 12.</b> <span class='sc'>Pietro Bembo</span>, (born at Venice 1470; died at Rome 1547),
was the son of a noble Venetian, Bernardo Bembo (a man of much cultivation,
who paid for the restoration of Dante’s tomb at Ravenna), and Elena Marcella.
Having received his early education at Florence, where his father was Venetian
ambassador, he studied Greek at Messina under Lascaris (a native of
Hellas, whose grammar of that tongue was the first Greek book ever printed,
1476), and philosophy at Padua and Ferrara, where his father was Venetian
envoy and introduced him to the Este court. Here he became acquainted
with Lucrezia Borgia, who had recently wedded Duke Ercole’s son Alfonso,
and to whom he dedicated his dialogues on love, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Gli Asolani</cite></span>. By some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>writers indeed he is said to have been her lover, but the report is hardly confirmed
by the character of the letters exchanged between the two, 1503-1516.
Having been entertained at Urbino in 1505, he spent the larger part of the next
six years at that court, where he profited by the fine library, delighted in many
congenial spirits, and became the close friend of Giuliano de' Medici, who took
him to Rome in 1512 and recommended him to the future pope, Leo X. On
attaining the tiara, Leo at once appointed him and his friend Sadoleto (see
note 242) papal secretaries, an office for which his learning and courtly accomplishments
well fitted him. His laxity of morals and his paganism were no
disqualification in the eyes of the pope, whom he served also in several diplomatic
missions, and from whom he received benefices and pensions sufficient
to enrich him for life. In 1518 his friend Castiglione sent him the MS. of <span class='sc'>The
Courtier</span>, requesting him to “take the trouble ... to read it either wholly
or in part,” and to give his opinion of it. Ten years later, when the book was
printed, it was Bembo to whom the proofs were sent for correction, the author
being absent in Spain. Even before the death of Leo X in 1521, Bembo had
entered upon a life of literary retirement at Padua, where his library and art
collection, as well as the learned society that he drew about him, rendered his
house famous. Nor was it less esteemed by reason of the presence, at its head,
of an avowed mistress (Morosina), who bore him several children. After her
death, he devoted himself to theology, entered holy orders, reluctantly accepted
a cardinal’s hat in 1539, and in 1541 succeeded his friend Fregoso in the bishopric
of Gubbio, to which was added that of Bergamo. His death was occasioned
by a fall from his horse, and he was buried at Rome in the Minerva
church, between his patrons Leo X and Clement VII. His works are noteworthy
less for their substance than for the refining influence exerted by their
form. He is said to have subjected all his writings to sixteen (some say forty)
separate revisions, and a legend survives to the effect that he advised a young
cleric (Sadoleto) to avoid reading the Epistles of St. Paul, lest they might mar
the youth’s style. His numerous private and official letters have preserved
many valuable facts and furnish interesting illustration of contemporary manners
and character. Humboldt praises him as the first Italian author to write
attractive descriptions of natural scenery, and cites especially his dialogue
on Mt. Ætna.</p>

native of Mantua, being descended from a younger branch of the ruling family
of that city, and a cousin of Castiglione, with whom he maintained a close
friendship. His father’s name was Giampietro, and he had a brother Luigi.
Having received a courtly and martial education at Milan, and after spending
some time with his relatives at Mantua, he entered the service of Duke Guidobaldo
of Urbino. In 1504 he shared Castiglione’s lodgings after their return
from a campaign against Cesare Borgia’s strongholds in Romagna, and in the
carnival of 1506 they together recited Castiglione’s eclogue <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Tirsi</cite></span>, in the authorship
of which he is by some credited with a part. A graceful canzonet, preserved
in Atanagi’s <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Rime Scelte</cite></span>, attests his skill in versification. On Guidobaldo’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>death in 1508, the two friends remained in the service of the new duke,
Francesco Maria. In 1511 Cesare fought bravely against the French at Mirandola,
and the next year took part in the reduction of Bologna, where he soon
died of an acute fever. Little more is known of him, beyond the fact that he
was a knight of St. John of Jerusalem, that Leo X sent him on a mission to
Charles V of Spain, and that he was among the many friends of the famous

close friend of Castiglione and a cousin of the latter’s mother. His boyhood
was passed at Mantua, and his happiest years at Urbino, where he was received
in 1496. In the pontificate of Julius II he went to Rome, and was made
Bishop of Tricarico, in southern Italy, 1511. Under Leo X he was entrusted
with several embassies, one of which (1514) was to England to reconcile Henry
VIII with Louis XII, and another (1515) was to the new French king, Francis
I, at whose court he continued to reside, and through whose influence he was
made Bishop of Bayeux in 1516. In 1526 and 1527 he served as French ambassador
to Venice. His ability and zeal as a diplomatist are shown not only
by the importance of the posts that he held, but by his numerous letters that
have been preserved. At the time of his friend Bibbiena’s death in 1520,
Canossa remarked that it was a fixed belief among the French that every man

(Arezzo) and in compliment to his ‘unique’ faculty for extemporising verse.
His father Benedetto was a jurist, and the author of a dull Latin history of the
First Crusade, from which Tasso is believed to have drawn material for the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Gerusalemme Liberata</cite></span>. His poetical celebrity commended him to the court
of Urbino, where (as at Rome and in other places) he was in the habit of reciting
his verses to vast audiences of rich and poor alike. When an exhibition
by him was announced, guards had to be set to restrain the crowds that rushed
to secure places, the shops were closed, and the streets emptied. His life was
a kind of lucrative poetic vagabondage: thus we find him flourishing, caressed
and applauded, at the courts of Urbino, Mantua, Naples, and especially at that
of Leo X, who bestowed many offices upon him, of which, however, his wealth
(acquired by his recitations) rendered him independent, enabling him to indulge
in a life of literary ease. His elder brother Pietro became a cardinal,
bought Raphael’s house, and is said to have had a hand in drafting the papal
bull against Luther in 1520. He was an early patron of his notorious
fellow-townsman Pietro Aretino. Such of his verse as has survived is
so bald and stilted as to excite no little wonderment at the esteem which he
enjoyed among his contemporaries. In <span class='sc'>The Courtier</span> he poses as the sentimental

was the son of Isaia di Pippo of Pisa and the pupil of Paolo Romano. Perhaps
best known as a sculptor, he possessed skill also as a goldsmith, medallist,
architect and crystal carver, cultivated music and wrote verse. During the
last years of the Sforza power at Milan, he accompanied the duke’s wife,
Beatrice d'Este, from place to place, and is now identified as the author of
her portrait bust in the Louvre. He executed also at least two portrait
medals of her sister Isabella d'Este, acted as adviser and agent of the Gonzagas
in the purchase of art objects, worked at Venice, Cremona, Rome and
Naples, and is known to have been at Urbino about the time of the Courtier
dialogues. In a long letter written by him to Bembo in 1510, he describes the
court of Urbino as “a true temple of chastity, decorum and pudicity.” In
1512 he was directing architect at Loreto (see note <a href='#f311'>311</a>), where he died in May,
bequeathing his collection of medals and antiques to a hospital, for the purpose
of having three masses said weekly for the repose of his soul.</p>

the duke’s army. He may have been identical with one Pietro dal Monte, who
is mentioned as a soldier in the pay of Venice (1509), and described as “blind
in one eye, but of great valour, gentle speech, and not unlearned in letters,”

Bembo as a German, but seems more probably to have been an Italian. Dennistoun
speaks of him as a musician. In a letter from Castiglione to his
mother (1506), the writer warmly commends to her “one messer Niccolò
Frisio, who I hear is there [i.e., in Mantua], and I earnestly hope that you will
treat him kindly, for I am under the greatest obligation to him with respect to
my Roman illness.... I am sure he loves me well.” In another letter by a
friend of Bembo, Frisio is described (1509) as an Italian long resident in courts,
sure of heart, gentle, a good linguist, faithful to his employers, and as having
been used by Julius II in negotiating the League of Cambray against Venice.
He had relations also with the marchioness Isabella of Mantua (see note <a href='#f397'>397</a>),
whom he aided in the collection of antiquities. Growing weary of worldly
life, he became a monk in 1510, and retired to the Certosa of Naples.</p>

of Florence, and beginning life as a barber to Lorenzo de' Medici, always remained
faithful to that family. At Rome, during the pontificate of Julius II,
he won the reputation and enjoyed the privileges of “the prince of jesters,”
and became even more famous under Leo X, upon whom as a child he had
bestowed affectionate care, and who as pope did not forget his kindness.
Thus in 1514 he was made <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>Frate piombatore</i></span>, or affixer of lead seals to papal
bulls, in which office he followed the architect Bramante, was succeeded by
the painter Sebastiano Luciani (better known as “del Piombo”), and admitted
earning yearly what would now be the equivalent of about £1600, by turning
lead into gold. While it remains uncertain whether he was more buffoon or
friar, he had a great love for artists, and even composed verse. He seems to
have continued in the enjoyment of fame and favour during the reign of the
second Medicean pope, Clement VII.</p>

Sebastiano. He lived long at the Gonzaga court, where he was employed
in organizing festivals, and at Urbino, where the few of his letters that have
survived show him in familiar relations with other interlocutors in <span class='sc'>The
Courtier</span>. While at Rome in 1507, with the suite of the Duchess of Urbino,
he was seriously wounded in the head by an unknown assailant, probably in
return for some lampoon or scandal of his against the papal court.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='f62'></a><b>Note <a href='#r62'>62</a> page 17.</b> This letter S was evidently one of the golden ciphers that
ladies of the period were fond of wearing on a circlet about their heads. In
her portrait the duchess is represented as wearing a narrow band, from which
the image of a scorpion hangs upon her forehead. The S may have been used
on this occasion as the initial letter of the word scorpion, and seems in any
case to have been an instance of the ‘devices’ mentioned in note 40.</p>

<p class='c001'>A sonnet, purporting to be the work of the Unico Aretino, was inserted in
the edition of <span class='sc'>The Courtier</span> published by Rovillio at Lyons in 1562 and
in several later editions, as being the sonnet here mentioned. In its place,
however, Cian prints another sonnet, preserved in the Marciana Library at
Venice and possessing higher claims to authenticity. Some idea of the baldness
of both may be gained from the following crude but tolerably literal

son of Duke Ercole I of Ferrara (see note <a href='#f203'>203</a>) and Eleanora of Aragon (see
note 399). At the instance of his maternal aunt Beatrice’s husband, King
Matthias Corvinus of Hungary (see note <a href='#f395'>395</a>), he was given the rich archbishopric
of Strigonio, to which was attached the primacy of that country, and
made the journey thither as a mere boy. In 1493 Alexander VI made him a
cardinal. Soon after the death of his sister Beatrice, her husband Duke
Ludovico Sforza of Milan gave him the vacant archbishopric of that city, and
the same year (1497) he exchanged the Hungarian primacy, with its burdensome
requirement of foreign residence, for the bishopric of Agria in Crete.
In 1502 he was made Archbishop of Capua in the kingdom of Naples, but
bestowed the revenues of the see upon his widowed and impoverished aunt,
the ex-Queen of Hungary, and a little later was made Bishop of Ferrara,—all
before reaching the age of twenty-four years. He was also Bishop of Modena
and Abbot of Pomposa. During his brother’s reign at Ferrara, the young
cardinal took an active part in public affairs, several times governing in
the duke’s absence, and showing brilliant capacities for military command.
After the accession of Leo X, he resided chiefly at Rome, where he was always
a conspicuous figure and carefully guarded his brother’s interests. He was a
friend and protector of Leonardo da Vinci, and maintained Ariosto in his service
from 1503 to 1517. A prelate only in name, regarding his many ecclesiastical
offices merely as a source of wealth, he united the faults and vices to
the grace and culture of his time.</p>

Ludovico, whose favour had been attracted by his personal charm, literary
accomplishments and rare skill in knightly exercises. When he married his
patron’s natural daughter Bianca, in 1489, Leonardo da Vinci arranged the
jousts held in honour of the wedding. Thenceforth he adopted the names
Visconti and Sforza, and was treated as a member of the ducal family. In
1496, at the head of the Milanese forces, he besieged the Duke of Orleans
(afterwards Louis XII) at Novara, but in 1500 he was captured by the French,
and after the final downfall of Ludovico (to whom he seems to have remained

painter’s house. Protogenes was absent, but a large panel stood ready for
painting. Apelles took a pencil and drew an exceedingly fine coloured line,
by which Protogenes on his return immediately recognized who his visitor
had been, and in turn drew a finer line of another colour upon or within the
first line. When Apelles saw this line, he added a third line still further subdividing
the one drawn by Protogenes. Later the panel was carried to Rome,
where it long excited wondering admiration in the Palace of the Cæsars, with

natural son of a notary, Pietro Antonio, of the village of Vinci, situated about
fourteen miles east of Florence. He studied some three years with Donatello’s
pupil Verocchio at Florence. Meeting small pecuniary success there, he removed
to Milan about 1483 and entered the service of Duke Ludovico Sforza,
who is said to have paid him the equivalent of £4000 a year while painting
the “Last Supper,” and for whom he completed in 1493 the model of a colossal
equestrian statue of Duke Francesco Sforza, never executed in permanent
form. He was employed by Cesare Borgia as military engineer, and in
that capacity visited Urbino in July 1502. His famous portrait known as the
“Monna Lisa” or “La Gioconda,” upon which he worked at times for four years,
was finished about 1504 and afterwards sold by him to Francis I. In 1507, he
had been appointed painter to Louis XII, but did not visit France until 1516.
On the election of Leo X in 1513, he journeyed to Rome in the company and
service of Giuliano de' Medici, who paid him a monthly stipend of £66. Although
he was received with favour by the new pope and lodged in the Vatican,
his stay in Rome was artistically unprolific, his interest at the time being
chiefly confined to chemistry and physics, and nature attracting him more
than antiquities, of which he spoke as “this old rubbish” (<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>queste anticaglie</i></span>).
Three years before his death he was visited at Amboise in France by Cardinal
Ludovico of Aragon, who is mentioned later in <span class='sc'>The Courtier</span> (p. 159), and
whose secretary left an interesting account of an interview with him, describing
the painter as then disabled by paralysis of the hand.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='f97'></a><b>Note <a href='#r97'>97</a> page 50.</b> <span class='sc'>Andrea Mantegna</span>, (born 1431; died 1506), was a native
of Vicenza and probably of humble origin. When a mere child he became
the pupil and adopted son of the noted painter and instructor, Francesco
Squarcione of Padua, and was soon enrolled in the painters’ guild of that city.
In 1449 he began painting for the d'Este at Ferrara, and between 1453 and 1459
he married Niccolosa, a daughter of Squarcione’s rival Giacopo Bellini, and
sister of the more famous brothers Gentile and Giovanni Bellini. He painted
also at Verona, and about 1460 entered the service of the Gonzagas at Mantua,
where the remainder of his life was chiefly spent, although he worked for Pope
Innocent VIII at Rome about the year 1488, before which date he was knighted
by the Marquess of Mantua. By one writer he is affirmed to have cast the
fine bust which ornaments his tomb at Mantua, and which is said once to
have had diamond eyes. He is known to have understood bronze casting,
and besides the brush and the engraver’s burin, he handled modelling tools,
while a sonnet of his has been preserved. Although praised by Vasari as
kindly and in every way estimable, he is shown by contemporary letters to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>have been rather irritable and litigious in private life. Albert Dürer tells us
that one of the keenest disappointments of his life was occasioned by the great
painter’s death before he was able to make an intended journey to Mantua for
the purpose of visiting Mantegna.</p>

<span class='sc'>Sanzio</span>,—(born 1483; died 1520), was a native of Urbino and the son of Giovanni
Santi and Magia Ciarla. The father was himself a painter of no mean skill,
and wrote a quaint rhymed chronicle of the Duchy of Urbino, which is preserved
in the Vatican and contains much interesting information. Having lost
both parents when he had reached the age of eleven years, and probably having
first studied at Urbino under Timoteo della Vite, Raphael was sent by a
maternal uncle to the studio of Perugino at Perugia. The rest of his short
life was an unbroken course of happy labour and brilliant success. In 1499
he seems to have been at Urbino for the purpose of arranging for the welfare
of a sister, and again in 1504, when, after executing several works (including,
it is believed, portraits of the duke and duchess) for the ducal family, he went
to Florence with a letter of commendation from Guidobaldo’s sister. From
1504 to 1508 he resided chiefly at Florence, although he again visited Urbino
twice, just before and probably soon after the date of the Courtier dialogues.
His friendship with so many members of the Urbino court (Giuliano de' Medici,
Bibbiena, Bembo, Canossa, and Castiglione), and even his acquaintance with
Julius II, probably began during these later visits to his native city. In 1508
he was called to Rome by Julius, and resided there until his death. On succeeding
Bramante as architect of St. Peter’s in 1514, he wrote to Castiglione:
“Sir Count: I have made drawings in several manners according to your suggestion,
and if everyone does not flatter me, I am satisfying everyone; but I
do not satisfy my own judgment, because I dread not satisfying yours. I am
sending them to you. Pray choose any of them, if you deem any worthy.
Our Lord [i.e. Leo X] in honouring me has put a great burden on my shoulders,—that
is, the charge of the fabric of St. Peter’s. I hope, however, not to
fall under it; and the more so, because the model I have made for it pleases
his Holiness and is praised by many choice spirits; but in thought I soar still
higher. I fain would renew the beautiful forms of ancient buildings, but know
not whether my flight will be that of Icarus. Vitruvius affords me much light
on the subject, but less than I need. As to Galatea, I should hold myself a
great master if she possessed half the fine things you write me; but in your
words I recognize the love you bear me: and I tell you that to paint one beautiful
woman, I should need to see several beautiful women and to have you
with me to choose the best. But as there is dearth of good judgments and of
beautiful women, I am using a certain idea that has occurred to my mind.
Whether this has any artistic excellence in it, I know not,—but I am striving
for it. Command me.” Passavant affirms that the ‘drawings’ mentioned at
the beginning of this letter were designs for a medal that Castiglione meant
to wear. Raphael is said to have painted two portraits of Castiglione, one of
which (1516) is in the Louvre and appears as the frontispiece to this volume.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>His epitaph was written by Bembo, while Castiglione composed a Latin elegy
in his honour.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='f99'></a><b>Note <a href='#r99'>99</a> page 50.</b> <span class='sc'>Michelangelo Buonarroti</span>, (born 1475; died 1564), was
a native of Caprese, a village about forty-seven miles south-east of Florence,
and the son of Ludovico Buonarroti Simoni and Francesca, daughter of Neri
del Sera. His first schoolmaster seems to have come from Urbino. Apprenticed
at the age of thirteen to Ghirlandajo, he soon came under the protection
of Lorenzo de' Medici. In 1496 he removed to Rome, and remained there five
years. From 1501 to 1504 he was working upon the great statue of David at
Florence, and prepared his cartoon for a vast fresco on the Battle of Cascina,
which, although never executed, was often copied, and is said to have exerted
a greater influence on the art of the Renaissance than any other single work.
In 1505 he was called to Rome to design a colossal mausoleum for Julius II.
The anxieties and disappointments connected with this project became the
continual tragedy of his long life. “Every day,” he wrote, “I am stoned as if
I had crucified Christ. My youth has been lost, bound hand and foot to this
tomb.” The matter was finally ended by the placing of his statue of Moses in
the church of San Pietro in Vincoli at Rome. In the spring of 1506 he was
present at the unearthing of the Laocoön, and at the date of the Courtier dialogues
he was engaged in casting a great bronze statue of Julius II at Bologna.
Duke Guidobaldo’s collection at Urbino seems to have included a Cupid made
by Buonarroti in imitation of the antique, originally owned by Cesare Borgia,
regained by him when he captured Urbino in 1502, and soon presented by him
to Guidobaldo’s sister-in-law, the Marchioness Isabella d'Este of Mantua.
The famous tomb statue of Giuliano de' Medici at Florence is hardly to be
regarded as a portrait, and was of course executed long after the period of <span class='sc'>The
Courtier</span>. In 1519 the Marquess of Mantua wrote to Castiglione, who was
his ambassador at Rome, regarding a monument to his father that he hoped
to have the master design. In 1523 Castiglione brought to Mantua a sketch
made by Buonarroti for a villa which the marquess intended to build at
Marmirolo.</p>

about forty miles north-west of Venice, and was reputed to be a natural son
of one Giacopo Barbarelli, a Venetian, and a peasant girl. Lack of data renders
a consecutive account of his life and work impossible. He was brought
up in Venice, and bred as a painter in the school of the Bellini. Vasari says
that he played upon the lute and sang well, and was of a gentle disposition.
Although he seems to have been exceptionally independent of great people, he
enjoyed the especial favour of the Marchioness Isabella d'Este of Mantua. In
a letter written from Venice in the year before that of the Courtier dialogues,
Albert Dürer declared Giorgione to be the greatest painter in the city, which
could then boast of the Bellini, Palma Vecchio, Carpaccio and Titian. One of
the most acute of recent critics, Mr. Bernhard Berenson, ascribes to him only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>seventeen existing pictures, of which the best known is the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Fête Champêtre</cite></span> in
the Louvre, while the only one whose authenticity is entirely free from doubt

represented Duke Guidobaldo, but unfortunately is lost.</p>

name is a Latinized form. To English students he is better known as <span class='sc'>Politian</span>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>and as the author of the oft-cited line, “Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur
in illis.” His father Benedetto Ambrogini died poor, leaving a widow
and five young children almost destitute. At the age of ten, Angelo studied at
Florence, and composed Latin poems and Greek epigrams while yet a boy.
At thirteen, he published Latin epistles; at sixteen, he began his Latin translation
of the Iliad; at seventeen, he distributed Greek poems among the learned
men of Florence; and at eighteen, he edited Catullus. He was received into
Lorenzo de' Medici’s household, and before he was thirty years old, he was
professor of Latin and Greek at the University of Florence and was entrusted
with the care of Lorenzo’s children. His pupils included the chief students
of Europe. A born poet, entitled to the middle place of honour between Petrarch
and Ariosto, he was the first Italian to combine perfect mastery of
Latin and a correct sense of Greek with genius for his own native literature.
Towards the close of his life, he entered holy orders and became a canon of
the Cathedral at Florence. He was ill formed, and had squinting eyes and an
enormous nose. His morals were lax. He was succeeded by Bembo as

On the death of his father Pietro in 1469, he succeeded jointly with his brother
Giuliano to the family wealth and political predominance. Giuliano’s assassination
in the Piazzi conspiracy of 1478 (which Poliziano witnessed and narrated
in Latin) left Lorenzo sole ruler, but like his predecessors, he governed
the republic without any title, by free use of money and great adroitness in
securing the elevation of his adherents to the chief offices of state. He was a
man of marvellous range of mental power,—an epitome of Renaissance versatility.
Never relaxing his hold on public affairs, among philosophers he passed
for a sage; among men of letters, for an original and graceful poet; among
scholars, for a Hellenist sensitive to every nicety of Attic idiom; among artists,
for a connoisseur of consummate taste; among libertines, for a merry and untiring
roysterer; among the pious, for an accomplished theologian. “He was
no less famous for his jokes and repartees than for his pithy apothegms and
maxims, as good a judge of cattle as of statues, as much at home in the bosom
of his family as in the riot of an orgy, as ready to discourse on Plato as to plan

(born 1494; died 1547), was the son of Count Charles d'Angoulême and Louise
of Savoy. His governor, Sieur de Boisy, strove to inspire him with a taste for
arms and a love of letters and art, and it was from romances of chivalry that
he derived much of his education and many of his ideas of government. He
succeeded his cousin Louis XII in January 1515, and one of the earliest functions
at his court was the marriage of his aunt Filiberta of Savoy to Giuliano
de' Medici, who is here represented by Castiglione (with what truth remains
uncertain) as having visited the French court shortly before the date of the
Courtier dialogues. Writing in 1515, the Venetian ambassador describes the
young king as being really handsome (the evidence of our nearly contemporaneous
medal illustration to the contrary), courageous, an excellent musician,
and very learned for one of his age and rank. Under his rule, relations
between France and Italy became closer and more active, and there began to
penetrate beyond the Alps that Italian influence which he later greatly increased
by marrying his son to Giuliano de' Medici’s great-niece Caterina.
His education had included a study of Italian literature and customs, and
besides Federico Fregoso and Ludovico da Canossa he received and honoured
many other illustrious Italians, among whom were Leonardo da Vinci and
Benvenuto Cellini. He caused search to be made in Italy for rare MSS., and
had them copied for his library. His reign, although clouded by defeats and
humiliations, began a true literary and artistic Renaissance in France.</p>

was Castiglione’s contemporary) says: “Although military excellence seems
to be extinct in Italy, this arises from the fact that the old methods were not
good and there has been no one who knew how to devise new ones. We have
great excellence in the members, if only it were not lacking in the heads. In
duels and engagements between small numbers, see how superior the Italians
are in strength, in dexterity, in resource. But when it comes to armies, they
make no showing; and it all proceeds from the weakness of the heads.
Whence it arises that in so much time, in so many battles fought in the last
twenty years, when an army has been purely Italian, it has always succeeded
ill.” Compare this opinion with Montaigne’s remark (<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Essais</cite></span>, II, c. 24) that the
officers of Charles VIII ascribed their easy Italian conquests to the fact that
“the princes and nobility of Italy took more pleasure in becoming ingenious

<p class='c001'><a id='f133'></a><b>Note <a href='#r133'>133</a> page 66.</b> The comparative merits of painting and sculpture were
a frequent subject of discussion during this period. The Renaissance writers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>had inherited from antiquity a fondness for seeking superiority or inferiority
in matters between which there exists such a diversity of character as to
render comparison unprofitable. According to Vasari, Giorgione maintained
“that in one picture the painter could display various aspects without the
necessity of walking round his work, and could even display, at one glance,
all the different aspects that could be presented by the figure of a man, even
though the latter should assume several attitudes,—a thing which could not
be accomplished by sculpture without compelling the observer to change his
place, so that the work is not presented at one view, but at different views.
He declared, further, that he could execute a single figure in painting, in such
a manner as to show the front, back, and profiles of both sides at one and the
same time.... He painted a nude figure, with its back turned to the spectator,
and at the feet of the figure was a limpid stream, wherein the reflection of the
front was painted with the utmost exactitude: on one side was a highly burnished
corselet, of which the figure had divested itself, and wherein the left side
was reflected perfectly, every part of the figure being clearly apparent: and on
the other side was a mirror, in which the right profile of the nude form was
also exhibited. By this beautiful and admirable fancy, Giorgione desired to
prove that painting is, in effect, the superior art, requiring more talent and
demanding higher effort.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In one of his letters, Michelangelo wrote: “My opinion is that all painting
is the better the nearer it approaches to relief, and relief is worse in proportion
as it inclines to painting. And so I have been wont to think that sculpture is
the lamp of painting, and that the difference between them might be likened to
the difference between the sun and moon.... By sculpture I understand an art
which operates by taking away superfluous material; by painting, one that
attains its result by laying material on. It is enough that both emanate from
the same human intelligence, and consequently sculpture and painting ought
to live in amity together, without these lengthy disputations. More time is
wasted in talking about the problem than would go to the making of figures in
both species.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='f135'></a><b>Note <a href='#r135'>135</a> page 68.</b> “Grottoes,” i.e. the Catacombs. Speaking in his autobiography
of the remains of ancient art found in the Catacombs, Benvenuto
Cellini says: “These grotesques have received this name from the moderns
because they were found by scholars at Rome in certain subterranean caverns,
which had anciently been rooms, chambers, studios, halls and the like. Since
these scholars found them in these cavernous places (which had been built by
the ancients on the surface and had become low), and since such low places
are known at Rome by the name Grottoes, for that reason they received the
name grotesques.” Cellini here tries to explain the origin of the name applied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>to ornaments (such as the arabesques of the Renaissance) in which figures,
human to the waist, terminate in scrolls, leafage, etc., and are combined with
animal forms and impossible flowers. In this sense the word was used as
early as 1502 in a contract between the Cardinal of Siena and the painter
Pinturicchio. It had of course not yet reached its modern signification, so
fully discussed in the appendix to Volume IV of Ruskin’s “Modern Painters.”
In Castiglione’s time it was not known that the catacomb decorations were
Christian, and in any case they were founded on pagan models.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='f147'></a><b>Note <a href='#r147'>147</a> page 73.</b> The original reads: <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>havendo prima danzato una bassa,
ballarono una Roegarze</i></span>. The <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>danza bassa</i></span> was of Spanish origin and is believed
to have consisted of sliding steps and of posturing, in which the feet
were not lifted. The verb <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>ballare</i></span> seems to be derived from the low Latin
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>balla</i></span>, a ball. In the Middle Ages the game of ball was accompanied with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>dance and song, and we may well believe that a class of dances, thus originating
and denominated generally <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>balli</i></span>, were more animated than the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>danza
bassa</i></span>. Although a Greek derivation has been ascribed to the word <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>roegarze</i></span>,
Cian affirms that the dance thus named was of French origin. The earliest
French translator of <span class='sc'>The Courtier</span> renders the word by <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>rouergoise</i></span>, which is
apparently derived from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Rouergue</i></span>, the name of an ancient French province
to the south-west of Lyons.</p>

<p class='c019'><a id='f148'></a><b>Note <a href='#r148'>148</a> page 75.</b> This passage reflects the medico-philosophical theories
which the Renaissance inherited from antiquity, and which regarded “the
vital spirits” as something far more tangible and material than what we call
the principle of life or vital spark. Compare the early conception of electricity
as a fluid substance. “Complexion” is of course here used to mean
temperament or constitution, and not the mere colour and texture of the skin.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='f149'></a><b>Note <a href='#r149'>149</a> page 77.</b> Duke <span class='sc'>Filippo Maria Visconti</span>, (born 1391; died 1447),
was the son of Giangaleotto and Caterina Visconti, and brother of Giovanni
Maria Visconti, whom he succeeded as Duke of Milan in 1412. He married Beatrice
di Tenda (widow of Facino Cane), who brought him nearly a half million
of florins dowry, besides her husband’s soldiers and cities, and thus enabled him
gradually to win back the Lombard part of his father’s duchy, which his brother
had lost. He was very ugly in person, and so sensitive that he rarely
appeared in public. Wily but unstable, he was continually plotting schemes
that seemed to have no object, and he mistrusted his own generals, even
Francesco Sforza, who turned against him, forced him to a ruinous peace, and
after his death was soon able to seize his duchy. In him the cruel selfishness
of the Renaissance tyrant did not degenerate into mad thirst for blood, as in
the case of his terrible brother. He read Dante, Petrarch and French romances
of chivalry, and even dallied with the Latin classics, but genuine learning was
neglected and despised at his court.</p>

<p class='c001'>Duke <span class='sc'>Borso d'Este</span>, (born 1413; died 1471), like his brother and predecessor,
was a natural son of Duke Niccolò III. Kindly and just, he was idolized by
the Ferrarese and especially by the women. He patronized letters and art
and was fond of splendid living, yet in spite of the luxury of his court, he left a
treasure of about a million pounds sterling. The art of printing was established
at Ferrara shortly before his death. He appears to have been himself
ignorant of Latin, and encouraged the literary use of Italian and the study of
French romance. Histories of Ferrara, as well as the writings of contemporary
humanists, are full of his generous deeds. His mild sway passed into a
proverb, and the time of “the good Duke Borso” was long remembered as a
kind of golden age.</p>

he married the latter’s niece, and achieved such distinction as a soldier as to
share with Francesco Sforza the fame of being the first <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>condottiere</i></span> of his day.

Bibbiena’s <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Calandra</cite></span> was first presented at Urbino. This and other passages

in the 15th century, it differed from a violin in having deeper ribs, a flat back,
and a broad centre-piece on which the sound post rested. Its neck was broad
and thin; it had from five to seven strings, and was made in four sizes, of which
the lowest pitched (the <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>violone</i></span> or double bass) is still in use. The tone of the

<p class='c001'><a id='f158'></a><b>Note <a href='#r158'>158</a> page 90.</b> The Pythagoreans supposed the intervals between the
heavenly bodies to be determined by the laws of musical harmony. Hence
arose the celebrated doctrine of “the music of the spheres” (already referred
to by Castiglione in the text, page 63); for in their motion the heavenly bodies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>must each occasion a certain sound or note depending on their distances and
velocities, which notes together formed a musical harmony, inaudible to man
because he has been accustomed to it from the first and has never had an
opportunity to contrast it with silence, or because it exceeds his powers of
hearing. Pythagoras himself (died about 500 B.C.) taught his disciples to sing
to the accompaniment of the lyre, and to chaunt hymns to the gods and to
virtuous men.</p>

that, “although there has been no lack of those who, at great cost of oil and
sleep, have exalted ... the fourth-day ague, the fly, and baldness, with most
tedious praise,” Folly is languishing without a eulogist. Among the works
of Lucian (<i>flor.</i> 160 A.D.) there is a brief humourous book in praise of the fly;
the philosopher Favorinus (<i>flor.</i> 120 A.D.) is said to have written a eulogy on
the fourth-day ague; and there is another on baldness by the early Christian

of Naples, and the son of Giacopo Niccolò and Masella di San Magno.
His boyhood was spent with his mother at San Cipriano, near her birthplace
Salerno. He soon made such progress in Latin and Greek that he was admitted
to the academy of the famous Pontormo, of whom he became the close
friend. Their effigies may be seen together in the Neapolitan church of Monte
Oliveto. He received a villa and a pension from the scholarly Aragonese
dynasty, to which he remained faithful with pen and sword, following Federico
III into exile (see note <a href='#f401'>401</a>) in 1501, and returning to Naples only after
his king’s death in 1504. He seems to have had a peaceful and honourable old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>age, active in works of piety and charity, and employing his leisure in study
and in the society of a certain noble lady for whom he had formed a lasting
Platonic friendship. His writings include marine eclogues, elegies, etc., in
Latin, but his best known work is <i>L'Arcadia</i>, an Italian prose romance interspersed
with verse, of which sixty editions are said to have appeared before
1600. It is regarded by Mahaffy as having originated the idea that the Greek
Arcadia was the especial home of pastoral poetry, and probably served Sidney
as a model for his poem of the same name. Hardly less famous were Sannazaro’s
anti-Borgian epigrams, to which Symonds ascribes no small part of the
gruesome legend of Lucrezia’s crimes. He was buried in a church built by
him near the so-called tomb of Virgil, and his monument behind the high altar
bears the Latin inscription by Bembo, in which he is described as “near alike
to Virgil’s muse and sepulchre.”</p>

mass, either in place of, or immediately after, the Plain Chaunt <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Offertorium</i></span> of

the service of the archbishop of the latter city, whom he accompanied to
Florence, and there became a friend of Cosimo de' Medici and a member of
the literary society of the place. In 1443 he was made Bishop of Bologna,
and four years later was elected pope, an elevation that he owed solely to his
reputation for learning and to the comparatively small esteem in which the
office was then held. The humanists were delighted at the election of one of
their own number. As pope, he devoted his revenues to maintaining a splendid
court, to the rebuilding of the fortifications and palaces of Rome, and to
the enrichment of scholars. During his pontificate the city became a work-shop
of erudition. He founded the Vatican Library, for which he collected
five thousand volumes, and the list prepared by him for Cosimo de' Medici to

Republic, used (among other occasions) in the symbolic ceremony of wedding
the Adriatic, which was enjoined upon the Venetians by Alexander III (pope

On each Ascension Day a ring was dropped from the Bucentaur into the Adriatic,
with the words, “we espouse thee, sea, in token of true and lasting dominion.”
The vessel bore the image of a centaur as figure-head. Of the last
of several successive Bucentaurs (demolished in 1824), a few fragments are
preserved in the Arsenal at Venice. In the 15th and 16th centuries the name
was applied to state vessels of ceremony elsewhere. By some the word is

was a native patrician of Volterra (a town about midway between Pisa and
Siena), being the son of Paolo Inghirami and Lucrezia Barlettani. Having
passed his early boyhood at Florence, he removed to Rome in 1483, where he
played the part of <cite>Phædra</cite> in Seneca’s tragedy <cite>Hippolytus</cite> (upon which Racine
founded his <cite>Phèdre</cite>) with such success that the name clung to him for life.
The play being interrupted by an accident to the scenery, he filled the interval
by improvising Latin verses for the entertainment of the audience. The performance
took place in the mausoleum of the Emperor Hadrian, which was
afterwards converted into the fortress known as the Castle of St. Angelo.
Tommaso was employed by Alexander VI in diplomatic affairs, crowned poet
by the Emperor Maximilian I, and made a canon of the Lateran and of the
Vatican. He seems to have been connected with the Vatican Library as early
as 1505, and became its prefect. Although Erasmus called him the Cicero of

made professor of literature at Bologna, and afterwards at Rome. In 1511 he
successfully defended Duke Francesco Maria of Urbino against the charge of
murdering Cardinal Alidosi. Instead of seeking to extenuate the deed, as done
in heat and under strong provocation, he boldly justified it on the ground that
his client was the instrument chosen by the Almighty to rid the world of a
monster of wickedness, and eloquently appealed to the tribunal to spare a
hero whose promise of future usefulness was precious to Italy. Beroaldo
was secretary to Cardinal Giovanni de' Medici, and on the latter’s election as

took an active part in the conquest of Granada. In 1494 he was sent to Italy
to aid Ferdinand II of Naples against Charles VIII, won a long succession of
victories over the French, and was finally made Constable and Viceroy of
Naples. Later, Ferdinand the Catholic, listening to slanderous reports regarding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>him, deprived him of office, and in 1507 recalled him to Spain, where he
died in disgrace. His good qualities were much admired by Castiglione, who

him a secretary at the same time with Bembo, (who shared with him the name

Clement VII, to whom he boldly declared that the sack of Rome (1527) was
inflicted by God as a punishment for human wickedness. Paul III created
him a cardinal in 1536. A sincerely pious man, he was conscious of the evils
of the Church and did not escape suspicion of heresy. He was a close friend
of Vittoria Colonna, and the Roman Academy often met at his house on the
Quirinal. Besides Latin poems (one of which, on the newly discovered Laocoön
group, made him famous), his works include commentaries on the Psalms
and the Epistle to the Romans, and a Latin exhortation to the princes and
people of Germany against Lutheran heresies. Although far from rich, he

caused many Greek MSS. to be brought into Italy (including works of Plato,
Aristotle and Plutarch), and was the first Italian to collect books for the express
purpose of founding a public library, in the execution of which design he was
prevented by his exile from anticipating Cosimo. He employed learned Greeks
to read to him, and was instrumental in inducing Chrysoloras to teach at

his father Giovanni’s house of business he cultivated the rare faculty for finance
that he afterwards employed in public administration and private commerce.
He inherited his father’s vast fortune in 1429, and made it a practice to lend
money to needy citizens and at the same time to involve the affairs of Florence
with his own,—thus not only attaching individuals to his interests, but rendering
it difficult to control state expenditures apart from his own bank. He
understood also how to use his money without exciting jealousy, and while
he spent large sums on public works, he declined the architect Brunelleschi’s
plans for a residence more befitting a prince than a citizen. He was an early
riser, and temperate and simple in his life. While ruling Florence with despotic
power, he seemed intent on the routine of his counting-house, and put forward
other men to execute his political schemes. Despite occasional checks, he so
firmly established the influence of his family as the real rulers of Florence that
they were not permanently expelled until the nineteenth century. Much of his
power was due to sympathy with the intellectual movement of the age, and
although he was not a Greek scholar, he had a solid education, and collected
MSS., gems, coins and inscriptions, employing his commercial agents in the
work. During a year of exile, he built a library at Venice, and later he built
one at Florence and another at Fiesole. His house was the centre of a literary
and philosophical society, which included all the wits of Florence and the
strangers who flocked to that capital of culture.</p>

Sforza of Milan, to whose duchy he laid claim as the grandson of Valentina
Visconti. The following year he conquered Naples in alliance with
Ferdinand the Catholic, but quarrelled with his ally over the division of the
country, with the result that his force was defeated by the “Great Captain”
at Garigliano in 1503, and withdrew from Naples in 1504. He joined the League
of Cambray against Venice in 1508, but in 1511 the Holy League was formed
against him, and in 1513 the French were again compelled to leave Italy. On
the death of Anne of Brittany in 1514, he married Mary, the youthful sister of

have said: “Dear, I leave thee my death as a New Year’s gift.” He was sincerely
regretted by his subjects, and was known as “The Father of His People.”
Michelet says of him: “He was a good man, honest by nature, sometimes absurd,
indiscreet, talkative, testy; but he had a heart, and the only way for men

<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>Both these pontiffs received a subsidy for his maintenance from his brother

Rome by order of Alexander VI. Of his life at the papal court, we get the
following glimpse in a letter from Mantegna to the Marquess of Mantua: “The
Turk’s brother is here, strictly guarded in the palace of his Holiness, who
allows him all sorts of diversion, such as hunting, music, and the like. He
often comes to eat in this new palace where I paint [i.e., the Belvedere], and,
for a barbarian, his manners are not amiss. There is a sort of majestic bearing
about him, and he never doffs his cap to the Pope, having in fact none;...
He eats five times a day, and sleeps as often; before meals he drinks
sugared water like a monkey. He has the gait of an elephant, but his people
praise him much, especially for his horsemanship: it may be so, but I have
never seen him take his feet out of the stirrups, or give any other proof of
skill. He is a most savage man, and has stabbed at least four persons, who
are said not to have survived four hours. A few days ago, he gave such a
cuffing to one of his interpreters that they had to carry him to the river, in
order to bring him round. It is believed that Bacchus pays him many a visit.
On the whole he is dreaded by those about him. He takes little heed of anything,
like one who does not understand or has no reason. His way of life
is quite peculiar; he sleeps without undressing, and gives audience sitting
cross-legged, in the Parthian fashion. He carries on his head sixty thousand
yards of linen, and wears so long a pair of trousers that he is lost in them,
and astonishes all beholders.”</p>

courts of Naples, Rome, Urbino, Mantua and Milan. His verse was by some
preferred to that of Petrarch, and the unbounded popularity which he enjoyed
was doubtless due to the skill with which he improvised to his own accompaniment

refusing to poison the cardinal at the desire of Alexander VI. On the
accession of Julius II, he was rapidly promoted in spite of the objections
raised in the consistory on the score of his questionable character. He was
made Bishop of Miletus, Bishop of Pavia, a cardinal (1505), Legate of the
Patrimony, Legate of Romagna, and Archbishop of Bologna. In these offices
he proved violently tyrannical and a ruthless and bloody persecutor, especially
of the Bolognese partisans of the Bentivogli; so that the city rose against him
in 1511 and drove him out. His assassination by young Francesco Maria

based upon his descent from the former Hohenstauffen rulers of that kingdom,
and also upon his adoption as heir by the last Angevin queen of Naples.
Scholarly, enlightened, generous and benevolent, he was the ideal type of
royal Mæcenas and the hero of his century. He often went afoot and alone
about his capital, saying that “a father, walking amid his children, has naught
to fear.” On one occasion when a galley full of soldiers and sailors was about
to sink, and the men he had ordered to their rescue were hesitating, he leaped
into a skiff, crying, “I prefer to be the companion rather than a spectator of
their death.” When Constantinople fell into the hands of the Turks in 1453,
he welcomed learned refugees to his capital; his court was a meeting-place for
the savants of his time; and even when engaged in war, his captains might be
seen gathered near their king, listening to his exposition of Livy instead of
wasting their leisure at games of chance. He was noted also for his gentle

Urbino and became the trusted counsellor of his uncle Federico, who left to
him the guardianship of the young duke, Guidobaldo. To personal valour and

(<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Purgatorio</cite></span>, iv, 25) and also by Machiavelli (Art of War, iv) as a place of great
natural strength. When in the spring of 1502 Cesare Borgia disclosed his
hostile designs against Duke Guidobaldo, the latter, knowing that he could
not hold out at Urbino, retired to San Leo, but soon afterwards fled in the
garb of a peasant, and the castle was surrendered. In the same year, however,
it was recaptured by stratagem. In the spring of 1503 it was besieged by the
adherents of Borgia, and bravely defended for six months by Ottaviano Fregoso
and the castellan Lattanzio da Bergamo (referred to in the text), in the hope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>of succour from Guidobaldo, who had taken refuge at Venice. Cian says that
the place at last fell and was not again recovered by Guidobaldo until after
the death of Alexander VI. On the other hand Dennistoun (ii, 13) asserts that
by a reinforcement of twenty-five men the castle was enabled to hold out until
Guidobaldo’s restoration; he assigns the incident in the text to the first capture
(1502), gives the name of the castellan as Scarmiglione da Foglino, and
affirms that the surrender was treacherous.</p>

(born 1478; died 1507), was an openly acknowledged son of Cardinal
Roderigo Borgia (afterwards Alexander VI) by Rosa Vanozza, who was the
mother also of Cesare’s sister Lucrezia. Created a cardinal on his father’s
accession, he procured the murder of his brother Giovanni in 1497, resigned
his cardinalate the same year, was given the French duchy of Valentinois in
1498, and married Charlotte d’Albret, daughter of the King of Navarre, in 1499.
Having been created Duke of Romagna by his father in 1501, he proceeded to
reduce the various fiefs comprised within his intended domain, including the
duchy of Urbino. After the death of Alexander VI, Cesare was held in captivity
by Julius II and by Ferdinand the Catholic, escaped to his father-in-law’s
court in 1506, and fell in battle the following year, the very day after the close
of the Courtier dialogues. Handsome, accomplished and subtle, he was a
patron of learning and an adept in the cruel and perfidious politics of his day.
Upon his public career is founded the famous <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Principe</cite></span> of Machiavelli, who

Leo X, (born 1475; died 1521). He was the second son of Lorenzo de’
Medici and Clarice Orsini, and an elder brother of the Magnifico of <span class='sc'>The
Courtier</span>. Made a cardinal at the age of thirteen, and exiled from Florence
with the rest of his family in 1494, he was present at the election of Alexander
VI, of whose character he is said to have shown true appreciation at the time
by remarking: “We are in the wolf’s jaws; he will gulp us down, unless we
make good our flight.” During the reign of Julius II, he seems to have been
subservient to that pontiff, and in 1511 was a member of the court of six cardinals
which acquitted the young Duke of Urbino of the charge of murdering
Cardinal Alidosi. The pontificates of Alexander and Julius had exhausted
Italy with wars, and the Christian world, weary of their scandalous violence,
hailed with relief the accession of the cultivated and seemingly gentle young
prelate, Giovanni de’ Medici. Of his reign,—so brilliant in art and letters, so
disastrous to the Church,—it is enough to say that the key is found in the
famous phrase with which, on his elevation to the Chair of St. Peter, he greeted
his brother Giuliano: “Let us enjoy the Papacy, since God hath given it us.”
To him the immortality of the soul was an open topic for debate, while he
regarded sound Latinity and a ready tongue as more important than true doctrine
and pure living. Sincerely zealous for the diffusion of liberal knowledge,
he was extravagantly munificent to artists, scholars and authors. Like all his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>family, after the first Cosimo, he was a poor financier, and on his sudden death
he was found to have pawned the very jewels of his tiara. His reckless
expenditure led to the sale of indulgences, and thus in no small degree to the
progress of the Reformation.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='f302'></a><b>Note <a href='#r302'>302</a> page 153.</b> <span class='sc'>The Duke</span>, i.e., Ludovico Sforza, “Il Moro,” (born
1451; died 1508), was the fourth son of the Francesco Sforza whom Duke Federico
of Urbino had helped to become Duke of Milan (and whose father, a
peasant condottiere, Muzio Attendolo, became known as Sforza by reason of
great personal strength),—and of Bianca Maria, a daughter of the last Visconti
duke of Milan. Early noted for his physical and mental qualities,
Ludovico read and wrote Latin fluently, had a tenacious memory, and was a
ready speaker. He was tall and of strongly marked features. Unlike his
horrible brother Galeazzo Maria, he shunned bloodshed. Banished from
Milan after his brother’s assassination in 1476, he returned in triumph in 1479,
and assumed the guardianship of his nephew Giangaleazzo, for whom he chose
as bride his sister’s child, Isabella (see note <a href='#f396'>396</a>), daughter of Alfonso II of
Naples. Having first sought the hand of Isabella d’Este (see note <a href='#f397'>397</a>),—who
was already betrothed to the Marquess of Mantua,—in 1491 he married her
younger sister Beatrice (see note <a href='#f398'>398</a>), whose influence is by some said to have
led him to aggravate the humiliation of his young nephew and niece, the
rightful duke and duchess. Being threatened by the latter’s father, the King
of Naples, Ludovico invited Charles VIII to enter Italy (1494) and assert the
Angevine claim to Naples. His unhappy nephew died the same year, not
without suspicion of having been poisoned by the uncle’s order, who thereupon
assumed the title as well as the despotic power of duke. Becoming alarmed
at the rapid success of the French in Italy, he joined the league formed
against them, and was afterwards punished for his treachery by being
expelled from Milan by Louis XII and carried to France. It is said that at
the time of his capture, the only favour he asked was to be allowed the use of
a volume of Dante. He died a prisoner in the Castle of Loches, where, after a
vain effort to escape, he was confined in an underground dungeon. At the
height of his prosperity his revenues exceeded those of any Italian state
except Venice. Policy and also his natural taste for intellectual pleasures led
him to copy the Medici in their patronage of art and letters. He aspired to
make his capital a modern Athens, and sought to attract men of fame and
talent from far and wide. Both Leonardo da Vinci and the architect Bramante
were in his pay.</p>

Feltre, wrote Greek with remarkable purity at the age of ten, became a nun at
nineteen, devoted her life to religious and literary exercises, and was regarded
as one of the most learned women of her time. Her niece (?), Barbara Gonzaga,

daughter and heiress of Duke Francis II of Brittany, which became permanently
united to the crown of France through her marriages to Charles VIII
(1492) and Louis XII (1499). Castiglione’s praise of her seems to have been in
the main justified. Although sometimes vindictive, she was generous, virtuous
beyond the standard of her time, and carried cultivation to the verge of
pedantry. She surrounded herself with artists, historians, minstrels and
poets, and formed a collection of MSS. and other precious objects, largely the
spoils of her husbands’ Italian campaigns. Branthôme called her “the

Louis XI and Charlotte of Savoy. Having succeeded his father in 1483, and
assumed royal power in 1491, he married Anne of Brittany and soon set about
enforcing his pretensions to the crown of Naples, transmitted to him through
his father and cousin from René of Provence, to whom the last Angevine ruler
had devised the kingdom in 1435. As we have seen, the immediate cause of
the invasion of Italy (1494) was a request from Duke Ludovico Sforza of Milan
and Pope Alexander VI. Although the expedition was undertaken without
adequate preparation and conducted with incredible foolhardiness,—continuous
good fortune together with the mutual jealousies of Italian princes and
the decadence of Italian military power enabled Charles to enter Milan, Florence
and Rome without hindrance, to seize Naples almost unopposed, and
(when threatened by a powerful league formed against him) to retire northwards,
to defeat the Italians at Fornovo, and finally to reach France in safety,
October 1495. His garrisons were driven from Naples in the following year,
but his foray had the immediate result of expelling the Medici from Florence,
and the far more important consequence of revealing to the rest of Europe the
wealth and helplessness of Italy,—thus paving the way for the subsequent
invasions with which the peninsula was scourged during the 16th Century.
The remainder of Charles’s life was given up to inglorious ease and pleasure.
A son of the painter Mantegna thus describes him: “A very ill-favoured face,
with great goggle eyes, an aquiline nose offensively large, and a head disfigured
by a few sparse hairs;” while Duke Ludovico Sforza said of him: “The
man is young, and his conduct meagre, nor has he any form or method of
council.” His own ambassador, Commines, wrote: “He was little in stature
and of small sense, very timid in speech, owing to the way in which he had
been treated as a child, and as feeble in mind as he was in body, but the kindest
and gentlest creature alive.”</p>

Infant Juan of Castile, but soon lost both husband and child. In 1501 she
married Duke Filiberto of Savoy, and after four years of happiness again
became a widow. In 1507 she was entrusted by her father with the government
of the Low Countries and the care of her nephew Charles (see note
462). She did much to further the progress of agriculture and commerce
in her dominions, and besides showing a lofty spirit and no little political

of Burgundy, who bore him five children and died in 1482. On the death of
his father in 1493, he was elected Emperor, and soon afterwards married
Bianca Maria, niece of Duke Ludovico Sforza of Milan. He was a member of
the league that forced Charles VIII to retire from Italy (1495), of the League
of Cambray against Venice (1508), and of the Holy League (1511) for the expulsion
of Louis XII from Italy. Although deriving little profit or honour from
these and other foreign enterprises, he contrived by prudent marriages to add
Bohemia and Hungary to his empire and to make Spain a possession of his
family. He also effected many reforms in his government, and even founded
several important institutions, such as a postal service and a permanent militia.
From his youth he showed a taste for study, became a patron of scholars,
poets and artists, and enriched the Universities of Vienna and Ingolstadt.

of works on gardening, hunting and agriculture, as well as on military science.</p>

with whom she succeeded jointly to her father’s crown in 1474, but was able to
gain complete possession of her dominions only in 1479, the same year in
which her husband succeeded his father as King of Aragon. Under her rule
the Inquisition was established in Castile (1480), but she recoiled before its
horrors and was reconciled to its continuance only by the direct assurance of
Pope Sixtus IV. In 1481 began the long war, which (largely owing to her
energy and perseverance) resulted in the expulsion of the Moors from Spain,
and in which she is said to have organized the earliest military hospitals.
The story of her noble patronage of Columbus is familiar. Her later years
were clouded by the loss of two of her three children, including her only son,
and by the unhappy conjugal life and mental disorder of her daughter, Juana,
the mother of Charles V. Castiglione’s praise of Isabella’s lofty qualities is
not a little justified by the facts of her life. In personal appearance, she is said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>to have been agreeable rather than handsome; her features were regular, her
green eyes vivacious, her complexion olive, her hair reddish blond, and her
stature above the medium.</p>

the most noted of which were his campaigns against the Turks and his siege

<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>no means the least part of his fame was won by the ardour with which he
advanced the cause of science, art and letters in his country, and bestowed

Sforza duke of Milan. In 1489 she made a splendid entry into Milan as the
bride of her own cousin Giangaleazzo Sforza, whose rights as duke were
gradually usurped by his uncle Ludovico il Moro. This usurpation has been
regarded as partly due to the ambition of Ludovico’s young wife, Beatrice
d’Este (see note <a href='#f398'>398</a>), who could not endure the precedence rightfully belonging
to Isabella. As has been seen, it was to protect himself against the wrath
of Isabella’s father and grandfather, that Ludovico invited Charles VIII into
Italy as his ally. When Charles reached Pavia, he had to endure the pathetic
spectacle of his forlorn cousin Giangaleazzo (they were sisters’ sons) in prison,
and to hear the piteous pleadings of the beautiful Isabella, who fell at his feet
and besought him to have mercy on her husband. Her appeal was withstood,
and Ludovico of course had no scruple in setting aside the rights of her infant
children. Fresh trials awaited her in her native country, to which she returned
in 1500, and from which her family had been expelled.</p>

child of Duke Ercole I of Ferrara and Eleanora of Aragon. Having had Mario
Equicola as preceptor, she married the Marquess Gianfrancesco Gonzaga (see
note 446) in 1490, her early betrothal to whom prevented her from becoming
the wife of Ludovico Sforza, the duke of Milan, who soon afterwards married
her sister Beatrice. At Mantua she continued her literary and artistic training,
and her court became one of the brightest and most active centres of
Italian culture. The chief poets and painters of the time laboured for her or
were her friends. Being for years in her husband’s service, Castiglione knew
her closely, maintained a frequent exchange of letters with her, and is only
one of many who praise her beauty, her intellect, and her moral qualities; she
may be regarded as the most splendid incarnation of the Renaissance ideal of
woman. Her long friendship with her sister-in-law, “My lady Duchess,” has
been already mentioned. Some interesting details have survived as to her
manner of ordering a picture. Having chosen a subject, she had it set forth
in writing by some humanist of her court. These specifications were then
given to the painter chosen for the purpose, and he was furnished with minute
directions as to the placing of the figures and the distribution of light, and
required to make a preliminary sketch. As the painting was often intended
for a specific space, she took great care to secure the exact dimensions desired,
by providing two pieces of ribbon to show the precise height and breadth of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>the picture. Isabella’s brilliant career, and especially her close relations with
the chief men of her day and her weighty influence upon contemporary politics,
are the subject of many scholarly volumes and interesting articles written
jointly by Alessandro Luzio of Mantua and Rodolfo Renier of Turin.</p>

Lucrezia Borgia. Younger, apparently less beautiful, and certainly less accomplished
than her sister Isabella, Beatrice encouraged her husband’s
patronage of art and letters, and took part in his turbid political schemes. It
will perhaps never be determined precisely to what extent she was responsible
for his treatment of his young nephew and of the latter’s wife (see note <a href='#f396'>396</a>),
and for the disasters to Italy that ensued, but she is known to have exercised
a great ascendency over her husband’s mind, and he is said to have spent at
her tomb the last night before his final capture and downfall. After the expulsion
of the French from Italy in 1512, her sons Maximilian and Francesco

and bore him two daughters and four sons. Other contemporary accounts
confirm the praise bestowed upon her by Castiglione, and show her to have
been a woman of rare merit, manly courage and enlightened culture. Fond
of music, and herself a player upon the harp, she seems to have been a discriminating
patroness of art and letters, and at the same time to have taken
an active share in the serious cares of government, especially when her husband
was absent or disabled. A pleasant glimpse of her character is gained
from a letter written by her to the duke’s treasurer on behalf of a certain Neapolitan
engineer, who had rendered important services but had fallen ill and
was in want. “You will see what this poor man’s needs are. You know with

immediate predecessor, Ferdinand II. Having taken part in the weak resistance
offered to Charles VIII’s invasion of Naples in 1494, he became king
on the early death of his nephew in October 1496, and seems to have tried to
keep aloof from the turbulent schemes in which Alexander VI sought to
involve him. After another vain attempt to withstand the invasion of Louis
XII, and having been shamefully betrayed by the Emperor Maximilian and
Ferdinand the Catholic, to both of whom he had appealed for aid, he retired
with his wife and children to the island of Ischia (which furnished refuge at
the same time to his widowed sister Beatrice, ex-Queen of Hungary, and to his
widowed niece Isabella, ex-Duchess of Milan), ceded his crown to Louis XII
in exchange for 30,000 ducats and the Countship of Maine, and spent the last
three years of his life in France.</p>

was besieged in Taranto during the Franco-Spanish invasion which resulted
in his father’s downfall. On a sworn promise to set him free, he surrendered
to the Great Captain (see note <a href='#f239'>239</a>), but was treacherously detained and sent as
a prisoner to Spain, where he was treated by Ferdinand the Catholic with
almost royal honours. He continued to reside in Spain, and on the death of
his mother in 1533, he was joined at Valencia by his two sisters.</p>

were a nomadic people allied to the Scythians and dwelt north-east of the
Caspian Sea. Herodotus relates that Cyrus the Great sent her an offer of
marriage, and on being refused, invaded her kingdom and captured her son,
but was finally defeated and slain, 529 B.C. The <span class='sc'>Artemisia</span> referred to in the
text is probably not the Queen of Halicarnassus (who fought on the Persian
side at Salamis in 480 B.C.), but rather the sister-consort and successor of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>King Mausolus of Caria, a state on the western coast of Asia Minor. On her
husband’s death in 352 B.C., she reigned two years until she pined away for
grief. The monument, Mausoleum, erected by her to his memory at Halicarnassus,
was regarded as one of the seven wonders of the world—the others
being: the Egyptian pyramids, the temple of Artemis at Ephesus, the walls
and hanging gardens of Babylon, Phidias’s statue of Zeus at Olympia, the
Colossus at Rhodes, and the lighthouse at Alexandria. <span class='sc'>Zenobia</span>, an Arab by
birth, was the second wife of Odenathus, King of Palmyra, which lay to the
east of Syria. On the death of her husband, about 266 A.D., she acted as
regent for her sons and seems to have shown great talent for war as well as
for the arts of wise administration; but in her effort to extend her sway over
the entire East, she was defeated by the Emperor Aurelian, and adorned his
triumph in golden chains at Rome. She was allowed to spend the remainder
of her life in dignified retirement at Tibur (Tivoli). <span class='sc'>Semiramis</span> was the
legendary daughter of the Syrian goddess Derketo, and with her husband
Ninus was regarded as the founder of Nineveh. On his death she assumed
the government of Assyria, built the city of Babylon and its wonderful
gardens, conquered Egypt, etc. To her the Greeks ascribed nearly everything
marvellous in the East. Her name appears in inscriptions as that of the
consort of an Assyrian ruler who reigned 811-782 B.C. <span class='sc'>Cleopatra</span>, (69-30
B.C.), was directly descended in the eighth generation from Ptolemy I, the
most noted of Alexander the Great’s generals and the founder of the Egyptian
dynasty that ended with her life. Her establishment as sole ruler, to the
exclusion of her two brothers, was due to the favour of Julius Cæsar, who
is said to have acknowledged the paternity of her son Cæsarion, ultimately
put to death by order of Augustus. Her love of literature, and the refinement
of her luxury, show her to have been no mere voluptuary.</p>

1513; see notes 10 and 42.</p>

<p class='c001'>Giuliano de’ Medici was created Duke of Nemours in 1515. As he died in
1516, Castiglione’s use of the present tense (‘that greatness where now he is’)
is inconsistent with the mention of Canossa as Bishop of Bayeux. See note 9.</p>

the eldest daughter of the Marquess Gianfrancesco of Mantua and Isabella
d’Este. In 1505 Castiglione negotiated her union with Francesco Maria della
Rovere, but the marriage did not take place until Christmas Eve 1509, upon
which occasion Bembo wrote to Federico Fregoso that he had never seen a
comelier, merrier or sweeter girl, and that her amiable disposition and surprisingly
precocious judgment won general admiration. She seems to have
maintained affectionate relations with her aunt and predecessor (“my lady
Duchess” of <span class='sc'>The Courtier</span>), whose fame quite outshone her own, and to have
exhibited in after life no little strength of character. She is said to have
excluded, and even to have expelled, great ladies of questionable morality from
her court. Titian’s portrait (1537) represents her in middle age, but his pictures,
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>La Bella</i></span> and <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Das Mädchen im Pelz</i></span>, as well as several of his Venus heads,
are generally regarded as idealized presentations of her more youthful face.</p>

last Persian aggressions and consolidated the Athenian supremacy. Although
an admirer of Spartan institutions, he seems to have been of a somewhat indulgent
disposition. The <span class='sc'>Scipio</span> here referred to, is probably Publius Cornelius
Scipio the Elder, who was the victor over Hannibal and died 183 B.C.

small and lame, he was the greatest Spartan commander, and became famous
for his victories against the Persian and Greek enemies of his country. <span class='sc'>Xenophon</span>,
historian, essayist and disciple of Socrates, was banished from Athens
about the time of Socrates’s death (399 B.C.), accompanied Agesilaus into Asia,
and wrote a panegyric upon him, regarded by Cicero as more glorious than
all the statues erected to kings.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='f437'></a><b>Note <a href='#r437'>437</a> page 252.</b> In Greek mythology Epimetheus (Afterthought) and
Prometheus (Forethought) were sons of the Titan Iapetus and the ocean
nymph Clymene. Angered by a deceit practised upon him by Prometheus,
Zeus withheld from men the use of fire; but Prometheus stole fire from heaven
and brought it to earth in a hollow reed. For this offence he was chained to
a rock where an eagle preyed daily upon his liver (which grew again in the
night), until he was finally liberated by Hercules. As compensation for the
boon of fire, Zeus sent Pandora (the first woman, endowed with beauty, cunning
and other attributes designed to bring woe to man) to be the wife of Epimetheus.
Although warned by his brother, Epimetheus accepted her, with
the result that she set free the evils which Prometheus had concealed in a
box. In a later form of the legend, she received from the gods a box containing
the blessings of life, and on her being moved by curiosity to open the box,
all of them (save hope) escaped and were lost.</p>

Solon of Athens, Chilon of Sparta, Cleobulus of Rhodes, Periander of Corinth,

<p class='c001'><a id='f446'></a><b>Note <a href='#r446'>446</a> page 274.</b> <span class='sc'>Gianfrancesco</span>—more commonly called <span class='sc'>Francesco</span>—<span class='sc'>Gonzaga</span>,
(born 1466; died 1519), was the eldest son of the Marquess Federico
of Mantua and Margarita of Bavaria, and a brother of “my lady Duchess.”
Having succeeded his father in 1484, he married (1490) Isabella d’Este, to
whom he had been betrothed at the age of sixteen. Like his ancestors and
most other petty Italian rulers of his time, he was at once <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><i>condottiere</i></span> and
sovereign prince. He commanded the Italian troops against Charles VIII,
and although with an overwhelmingly superior force he failed to block the
retreat of the French at Fornovo, he treated that disgraceful affair as a glorious
victory, and even caused it to be commemorated by Mantegna in a votive
picture now in the Louvre. He served successively as captain of the imperial
troops in Italy, as commander of Duke Ludovico Sforza’s army, as viceroy of
Naples under Louis XII, etc. He joined the League of Cambray and was
taken prisoner by the Venetians. In the general disorders that filled the
period of his reign, he and his more brilliant wife had the address to protect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>his dominions from the ravages of war. Although, as Castiglione’s natural
lord, he was asked and gave his consent to the latter’s entry into the Duke
of Urbino’s court (1504), he seems to have continued to resent the affair until
Castiglione’s return (1516) to his service,—in which the author remained when
this part of the text was written. Castiglione’s eulogy was far from undeserved,
for to the Marquess’s munificence, no less than to his consort’s taste
and enthusiasm, must be ascribed the lustre of their provincial court. Besides
being a patron of art and letters, he was also a successful breeder of horses
for use both in war and in racing.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='f447'></a><b>Note <a href='#r447'>447</a> page 274.</b> The duke is said to have had no small share in planning
the palace; his chief architect was one Luciano, a native of Laurana in
Dalmatia on the eastern coast of the Adriatic. The cost of the structure was
about £400,000 sterling. See, besides the authorities cited in note 28, Luzio

by 1450, but little was done towards rebuilding it until 1506, when the execution
of Bramante’s plan was begun with the solemn laying of the first stone by
Julius II on Sunday, 18 April. On the death of Bramante, Raphael was put in
charge of the work in 1514, as we have seen (note 98), but, apparently owing to
lack of funds, progress was slow until 1534 when Michelangelo’s designs were
substituted. The dome was completed in 1590, and the church dedicated
in 1626.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='f449'></a><b>Note <a href='#r449'>449</a> page 274.</b> This ‘street’ was designed by Bramante to be a kind

to be bordered by palaces, courts, gardens, porticoes, terraces, etc., but the
death of Julius II led to the abandonment of the plan.</p>

<div class='fnote'>

<p class='c001'><a id='f450'></a><b>Note <a href='#r450'>450</a> page 274.</b> Pozzuoli (the ancient Puteoli), situated seven miles
west of Naples, was originally a Greek city, but became one of the chief commercial
ports of the Roman Empire, and a resort of the patrician class. It is
noted for its ruins, especially those of a large amphitheatre.</p>

<p class='c001'>Baja (the ancient Baiæ), on the Gulf of Pozzuoli, was the chief Roman watering
place, famous for its luxury, and containing the villas of many celebrated
Romans. Its principal antiquities are ruins of baths.</p>

<p class='c001'>Civita Vecchia lies on the coast about thirty-eight miles north-west of
Rome, and was anciently known as Centum Cellæ. The Emperor Trajan
(reigned 98-117 A.D.) converted it from a poor village into a great seaport, and
of his monuments some remains are still extant.</p>

<p class='c001'>Porto was a Roman city near the mouths of the Tiber. In Castiglione’s
time it had become a marshy island. One of the earliest Italian archæologists,
Flavio Biondo, visited the site in 1451, and found there many huge marble
blocks ready for building and bearing quarry marks of the imperial period.
The Apollo Belvedere was discovered here in 1503.</p>

which Raphael (who had been appointed guardian of antiquities) wrote to Leo
X, urging the pontiff to avert the complete destruction of “that little which
remains of Italian glory and greatness in proof of the worth and power of those
divine minds.” Castiglione was long supposed to be the author of the letter,
but is now believed only to have aided Raphael in its composition.</p>

<p class='c001'>Bucephalia (founded 327 B.C.) was situated on the river Hydaspes (the
modern Jhelum), a branch of the Indus, about 120 miles north-west of Lahore,
and was named in honour of Alexander’s favourite horse, which died there.
Bucephalus (ox-headed) is supposed to have been a name given to Thessalian

<p class='c001'><a id='f453'></a><b>Note <a href='#r453'>453</a> page 274.</b> Mount Athos (6780 feet high) forms the extremity of the
easternmost peninsula of Chalcidice in Macedonia. During the Persian invasion
of Xerxes (480 B.C.) it was temporarily converted into an island, and since
the Middle Ages has been noted for its monasteries. Both Vitruvius and
Plutarch give an account of the project mentioned in the text, and ascribe it
to a Macedonian architect who appears under the names, Dinocrates, Cheirocrates,
and Stasicrates,—and who also planned the city of Alexandria and
was chosen to rebuild the great temple of Artemis at Ephesus. The statue
was to represent Alexander, who is said to have abandoned the idea when he
learned that the city to be placed in the hand of the statue would be without
territory and could be provisioned only by sea,—saying that such a city would
be like a child that cannot grow for failure of its nurse’s milk.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='f454'></a><b>Note <a href='#r454'>454</a> page 275.</b> In Athenian legend <span class='sc'>Procrustes</span> was a cruel robber,

<p class='c001'><span class='sc'>Sciron</span> was another legendary Attic robber, who compelled his victims to
wash his feet on the Scironian rocks near Athens, and then kicked them into

was slain by Theseus, and in the same manner in which he had slain others.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Roman myth <span class='sc'>Cacus</span> was a gigantic son of Vulcan, living near the site of

Tyrannicide became honourable; and the proverb, ‘He who gives his own
life can take a tyrant’s,’ had worked itself into the popular language.” (Symonds’s

he married (in accordance with his parents’ wish) his elder brother Arthur’s
widow, Catherine, the youngest child of Ferdinand and Isabella the Catholic.
His accession was hailed with enthusiasm. Left rich through his father’s
avarice, he was generous, frank, handsome, exceptionally robust, and an
accomplished athlete and scholar. Good men were delighted with the purity
of his life, his gaiety pleased the courtiers, and sober statesmen found in him a
singular capacity for business. Besides being a musician, he spoke Latin,
French and Spanish, and was very devout,—usually attending mass five times
daily. Even as late as 1521 he dedicated to the pope an anti-Lutheran tract
on the Seven Sacraments, and in return received the title of Defender of the
Faith. As an offset to the enormities of his later life, it is only just to remember
that he raised England to the rank of a great European power, and that
for twenty years he did nothing to mar the harmony of his reign.</p>

in gathering a strong party, landed in England and wrested the crown
from Richard III, 1485. Soon afterwards, by his marriage to Edward IV’s

marriage of his daughter Margaret to James IV of Scotland finally led (on the
failure of his son’s issue) to the accession of the Stuarts in the person of her
grandson, James I.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='f461'></a><b>Note <a href='#r461'>461</a> page 276.</b> This is consistent with the earlier passage (see page <a href='#Page_8'>8</a>)
where Castiglione pretends to have been absent in England at the date of the
Courtier dialogues. An earlier MS. version here reads: “as we are told by
our friend Castiglione, who has just returned from England,” which accords
with what we have seen (note 23) to be the fact.</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='f462'></a><b>Note <a href='#r462'>462</a> page 276.</b> <span class='sc'>Don Carlos</span>, afterwards the Emperor Charles V, (born
1500; died 1558), was the son of the Emperor Maximilian’s son Philip of Austria,
and of Juana, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella the Catholic. Born and bred
in the Low Countries, and educated at least partly under the care of the future
pope Adrian VI, he is said to have shown less taste for study than for military
exercises, and on his accession to the Spanish throne in 1516, he was ignorant
of the Spanish language. By right of his grandmother Mary of Burgundy, he
already held the Netherlands. As representative of the house of Aragon,
he was king of Naples and Sicily. On the death of his grandfather Maximilian
in 1519, he inherited Austria, and (in spite of the rivalry of Francis I and the
intrigues of Leo X) was elected Emperor;—thus achieving, without a blow, a
dominion vaster than any in Europe since the time of Charlemagne.</p>

<p class='c001'>In an earlier MS. version the text here reads: “Then messer Bernardo Bibbiena
said: ‘I do not think that any of those present, except myself, have seen
the prince Don Carlos, who, having recently lost such a father as the king
Don Philip was, has shown such courage and wisdom in this great bereavement,
that although he has not reached the tenth year of his age, we may
nevertheless regard him as competent to rule over all his hereditary possessions,
vast though they be,—and that the Empire of Christendom (which men
think will be in his hands) must grow not a little in power and dignity.’”</p>

<p class='c001'><a id='f463'></a><b>Note <a href='#r463'>463</a> page 279.</b> <span class='sc'>Federico Gonzaga</span>, the first Duke of Mantua, (born
1500; died 1540), was the son of the Marquess Gianfrancesco Gonzaga and
Isabella d’Este. At the age of ten he spent some time as the hostage-guest
of Julius II at Rome, where he seems to have been generally caressed. Raphael
is known to have introduced the boy’s face into one of the Vatican frescoes,
and a little later to have painted his portrait. Having succeeded his
father as marquess in 1519, he waged war for Leo X against the French. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>1527 he joined the league of Italian princes against Charles V, but went over
to the Emperor’s side two years later, and was created Duke of Mantua. In
1531 he married Margarita Paleologus. Both Giulio Romano and Benvenuto
Cellini were in his employ.</p>

then known (Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn), in addition to the
Sun and Moon, which were until long afterwards regarded as planets. “The
sun, the moon and the five planets were always to be found within a region
of the sky extending about 8° on each side of the ecliptic. This strip of the
celestial sphere was called the Zodiac, because the constellations in it were
(with one exception) named after living things (Greek ζῷον, an animal); it was
divided into twelve equal parts, the Signs of the Zodiac, through one of which
the sun passed every month, so that the position of the sun at any time could
be roughly described by stating in what ‘sign’ it was.” Arthur Berry’s
“Short History of Astronomy” (London, 1898), p. 13.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
